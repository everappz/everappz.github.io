## Why Keyword Optimization is Critical for App Success

Every word in your App Store title, subtitle, and keyword field affects your search ranking. Optimized metadata means:

- Better visibility for your app
- More organic downloads
- Broader audience reach
- Improved ranking in multiple locales

But managing metadata manually — especially across several languages — can be a hassle. That’s where the [App Store Keyword Optimization Tool](https://appkeywords.pro) comes in.

## What Is the Free App Store Keyword Optimization Tool?

[AppKeywords.pro](https://appkeywords.pro) is a lightweight, browser-based tool built for indie developers, marketers, and teams. It lets you create and validate App Store metadata quickly — no signup, no tracking, no backend.

### Highlights:

- No login or data collection — 100% local in-browser
- Title, subtitle, and keyword fields with real-time character limits
- Instant keyword optimization and cleanup
- Duplicate detection and keyword bubble UI
- Autosaves your progress automatically in the browser
- Import/export JSON support for Fastlane workflows

## Step-by-Step: How to Use It

### 1. Enter Your Metadata

Each locale includes fields for:

- App **Title** (30 characters max)
- **Subtitle** (30 characters max)
- **Keywords** (100 characters max)

The character count updates live, so you never exceed Apple’s limits.

### 2. Optimize Keywords

Click the **Optimize** button to:

- Replace all spaces with commas
- Normalize international comma characters
- Trim excess commas and whitespace
- Detect duplicates from your title and subtitle
- Highlight keyword bubbles (blue = good, red = duplicated)

Click any bubble to remove the corresponding keyword.

### 3. Autosave and Local Privacy

All changes are autosaved in your browser (localStorage). No content is sent to a server. This means:

- No account required
- You can safely close the tab and continue later
- Fully private — your data never leaves your device

### 4. Import/Export JSON Metadata

Use the **Import** button to load a previously saved `.json` file.

Use **Export** to save your current metadata setup for future reuse or CI/CD integration.

### 5. Fastlane Script Integration

Inside the tool's GitHub repo, there are two helpful Bash scripts to support Fastlane:

```bash
meta_to_json_dict.sh       # Converts Fastlane metadata into JSON
json_dict_to_meta.sh       # Converts JSON back into Fastlane folders
```

These scripts help bridge the gap between your Fastlane setup and this optimization tool — making it easier to sync localized metadata during app deployment.

## ASO Tips for Better Rankings

- Use **unique, intent-based keywords** (avoid generic words like "app", "mobile", etc.)
- Don’t duplicate keywords across title, subtitle, and keywords
- Use **all 100 characters** in the keywords field
- Localize metadata for **every major market**
- Refresh keywords quarterly based on analytics and seasonality

## Conclusion

App Store Optimization doesn't have to be painful. With smart planning, clean metadata, and the right tools — like [appkeywords.pro](https://appkeywords.pro) — you can dramatically increase your app’s visibility and organic downloads.

Start optimizing smarter today. Your next user is one search away.
