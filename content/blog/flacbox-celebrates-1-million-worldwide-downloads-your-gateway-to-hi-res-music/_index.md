We are thrilled to share a major milestone — **Flacbox** has officially surpassed **1 million downloads** across the globe. This achievement celebrates not only the growth of our app but the power of a global community that truly values high-resolution, lossless music.

Thank you to every listener, tester, and audiophile who helped shape Flacbox into what it is today. Your feedback, bug reports, and feature suggestions continue to guide our evolution.

## Why Flacbox Stands Out

Flacbox is more than just a music player — it's a hi-res audio experience built for those who demand precision, quality, and flexibility. Here's what makes it the go-to music app for discerning listeners:

### Lossless Audio Format Support

Experience true audio fidelity with support for:

- FLAC  
- ALAC  
- APE  
- DSD  
- WV  
- TTA  
- RA  
- RM  

Flacbox plays back your music exactly as it was recorded, offering crystal-clear detail for every genre.

### M3U and CUE Playlist Support

Manage and organize your music with support for both **M3U** and **CUE** playlists. Whether you're archiving an entire album or curating a DJ-style mix, Flacbox has you covered.

### Built-in 10-Band Equalizer

Customize your sound with a powerful 10-band equalizer and genre-specific presets. Adjust frequency ranges manually or use quick presets to match your listening environment.

### Offline Playback

Download tracks, albums, or entire folders for offline playback. Great for traveling, commuting, or areas with no data coverage — your music is always available.

### Cross-Device Synchronization

Keep your music in sync across all your devices — **iPhone, iPad, and Mac** — so your library and playback history follow you wherever you go.

## Thank You to Our Global Audio Community
