We’re excited to unveil a major update for **Flacbox** — your go-to FLAC music player for iPhone and iPad. With version 1.6, we’re rolling out some of the most requested features, plus a few powerful enhancements to take your music experience to the next level.

Whether you're streaming from the cloud or playing hi-res files locally, Flacbox delivers uncompromised audio fidelity.

## What’s New in Flacbox 1.6

### Automatic Music Library Sync

Manually managing your music library is now a thing of the past. Our new sync engine automatically scans selected cloud folders and updates your music library in real-time.

- Enable it via: **Settings → Music Library → Automatic Sync**
- Select folders via **Sync Folder → Change Settings**
- Choose sync mode: Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi + Cellular
- Enable **Background Sync** to auto-update while the player is active (note: increases battery usage)

Your audio collection stays up-to-date automatically — no manual refresh needed.

### 10-Band Equalizer

Customize your sound with our built-in **10-band equalizer**, available from both the Player screen and the Settings menu.

- Adjust frequency levels between **-12 dB** and **+12 dB**
- Use built-in presets or define your own
- Modify preamp power with caution to protect your hearing

This professional-grade equalizer lets you tailor your audio for every listening environment.

### OPUS File Format Support

We’ve expanded file format compatibility by adding support for the **OPUS** codec. You can now play high-efficiency OPUS files alongside other formats like FLAC, ALAC, and MP3 — all with equalizer support included.

### External Flash Drive Integration

Now you can **plug in an SD or microSD card** and play music directly from external flash memory:

- Use a **Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader Adapter**
- Insert the flash card and connect to your device
- Open Flacbox — it will recognize your card automatically
- In **Services**, tap the “PowerDrive” section to browse and play files

This feature is ideal for conserving device storage and expanding your mobile music library.

### Stability and Playback Fixes

We’ve addressed a common playback bug: a **2-second skip at the end of FLAC files** has been fully resolved. Your tracks now play back seamlessly from start to finish.
