This highly requested feature is now a reality. With automatic sync, you no longer need to manually scan folders every time your cloud content changes. Evermusic will track changes to selected folders and keep your Music Library updated in the background. Simply choose which folders to monitor and let Evermusic do the rest.

## Save Playback Position – Perfect for Audiobooks and Lectures

Now you can pause your audio and pick up right where you left off—automatically. This new option is ideal for audiobooks, lectures, podcasts, or long-form music. Enable it in the app’s audio settings to make Evermusic remember your media position without the need to create bookmarks manually.

## Read Metadata in the Background – Keep Your Library Organized

If you’ve got a large music collection, background metadata reading is a huge time-saver. While you use other features or let Evermusic run in the background, the app reads your audio file metadata to sort your music by Artist, Album, and Genre faster than ever before.

## Correct Audio Tags – Keep Your Music Tidy

Evermusic now helps keep your metadata clean and accurate. It automatically detects and corrects invalid tags using online databases. This ensures that your library remains consistent and organized, even if your files have incomplete or messy ID3 tags.
