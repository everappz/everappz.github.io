## Cloud Services

**Evermusic** supports a wide range of popular cloud services including iCloud Drive, Google Drive, Dropbox, MEGA, OneDrive, Box, WebDAV, SMB, and more. This makes it an ideal hub for users with distributed music libraries.

**VOX**, by contrast, focuses on its proprietary VOX Cloud, which provides high-quality audio streaming but limits flexibility if you prefer third-party cloud platforms.
