## Evermusic 3.1 Update: New Features and Enhancements

We are excited to introduce **Evermusic 3.1**, a major release that delivers powerful improvements to your music listening experience. This version brings new playback capabilities, a redesigned music library, enhanced file safety, and more intuitive controls. Here's everything that's new in version 3.1:

### Crossfade Playback

Enjoy smoother transitions between songs with the **Crossfade Playback** feature. Designed for continuous listening, this option eliminates gaps between tracks—ideal for classical music, live recordings, and curated playlists. Users can configure the crossfade duration from 3 to 15 seconds or disable it entirely. To activate, navigate to:

`Settings → Audio Player → Crossfade Playback`

### Redesigned Music Library

The **Music Library** has been reimagined with a cleaner, more intuitive interface:

- Quickly access your songs, artists, and albums.
- Use the new **Synchronization** button to refresh your library after uploading new tracks to your cloud storage.
- Sort content by Name, Size, Track Number, Album, or Artist.
- Adjust **metadata scanning speed** via:

`Settings → Music Library → Metadata Reading`

### Music Library Backup and Restore

Keep your music data safe with the new **Backup & Restore** tool:

- Back up your entire library, including playlists, song metadata, cover art, and app settings.
- Archives are saved to cloud storage in a single file.
- Restore with a single tap whenever you need.

Access this via:

`Settings → Backup & Restore`

### Enhanced Audio Player Queue

New options give you better control over the playback queue:

- Add songs to **Play Next** or **Play Later**.
- Reorder or remove tracks easily.

### iPod Library Integration

Browse your iPod library directly from Evermusic’s main screen. Add iPod tracks to your playback queue or transfer them to the app’s Files section.

Categories include:

- Playlists
- Albums
- Artists
- Genres

### Account Editing Improvements

You can now edit login credentials for all connected cloud services without removing and re-adding them. This makes managing accounts more seamless and less error-prone.

### Updated Tags Editor

The **Audio Tags Editor** now offers better handling of metadata correction:

- Use the improved **Identify** action to scan filenames and update ID3 tags.
- Quickly fix broken metadata or add missing album info.
