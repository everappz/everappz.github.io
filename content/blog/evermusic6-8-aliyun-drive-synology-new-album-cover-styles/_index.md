We’re excited to announce the release of **Evermusic 6.8**, a major update that enhances your music playback experience and expands cloud compatibility for iOS and macOS users. Here's everything that's new:

## Minimal Audio Player Screen

Enjoy a clean, distraction-free interface with our **new fullscreen album cover style**. This display mode reduces on-screen clutter and presents just the essentials for a focused listening experience.

> Enable under:  
> `Settings > Audio Player > Personalization > Audio Player Screen Style`

## Aliyun Drive (阿里云盘) Integration

By user request, Evermusic now supports **Aliyun Drive**, a popular cloud storage provider in China. Access your 阿里云盘 files directly from within the app — perfect for users looking to consolidate their media across platforms.

## Synology Drive Support with QuickConnect

Connect your **Synology NAS** directly using **QuickConnectID** for instant access, even outside your home network. No manual IP configuration or VPNs required.

## New Album Cover Scroll Effects

We’ve added multiple new styles for album cover browsing:

- MacDoc  
- Linear  
- Rotary  
- Inverted Rotary  
- Cylinder  
- CoverFlow

> Adjust under:  
> `Settings > Audio Player > Personalization > Album Covers Scrolling Style`

## Customizable List Cells for Small Screens

You now have full control over the layout of list cells. Switch to **compact mode**, reduce spacing, or use **smaller icons** to maximize visible text — especially useful on smaller devices.

> Customize under:  
> `Settings > Personalization > List Cells Style`

## Drag and Drop File Management

Organize your files intuitively with our new **drag-and-drop** feature in the file browser. Move, sort, or arrange your content faster than ever.

## Faster Album Cover Loading

Album art now loads more efficiently, especially for:

- Genre views  
- Album and track views  
- Cloud-stored files with embedded artwork

> Optionally enable embedded cover support for cloud-stored files under:  
> `Settings > Music Library > Album Covers > Load Album Covers for Online Files`

## iTunes Library Cover Fix

We’ve fixed a longstanding issue where **album covers from iTunes libraries** were not displaying properly in Evermusic. Artwork for iTunes tracks now appears reliably across your library.

## Summary

This update focuses on performance, personalization, and deeper integration with your favorite cloud services. With Aliyun Drive, Synology, new UI styles, and file management tools, Evermusic 6.8 continues to push forward as the most advanced cloud-based audio player for iOS.
