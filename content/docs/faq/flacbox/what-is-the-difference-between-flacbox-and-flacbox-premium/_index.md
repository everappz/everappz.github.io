## Choose Your Premium Plan

The free version of the application offers a one-time lifetime in-app purchase and two subscription options (1 month and 1 year) to remove all restrictions and upgrade to the Premium version, allowing you to choose the best and most optimal price for you. Prices may vary depending on your country or territory. Also, please keep in mind that **Family Sharing** is enabled for all purchases and plans, so you can share the Premium version with members of your family.

## Sharing Purchases Between iOS and Mac
Lifetime purchases and subscriptions are shared between iOS and Mac, using iCloud to sync this information. If you have the premium version on your iOS device, please ensure you have the latest version installed and that iCloud is enabled. Start the app on iOS and wait one minute for your purchase information to upload to iCloud.

You can also try pressing the "Restore Purchases" button in the app settings. Afterward, install the latest app version from the App Store on your Mac and start the app. Ensure you have an internet connection and are using the same iCloud and App Store account on your Mac that you used on your iOS device. Wait one minute for the app to download purchase info from iCloud. The premium version should activate on your Mac automatically.

## Restore on a New iOS Device
To restore your purchase on the new device just use the "Restore purchases" menu. You will see the list of your purchases. If you don't see all your purchases please check if the device is connected to the same iTunes account that was used to make purchases, and make sure iCloud is enabled.
