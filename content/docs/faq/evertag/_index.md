{{% details title="Is Evertag safe?" closed="true" %}}
Evertag uses only official SDK and secure connections to interact with connected cloud services. Your login and password are not available for the application. All requests from the application to the cloud service are encrypted.<br>
When you enter login and password the application shows you the official authorization page that is provided by the cloud service provider and all authorization process is made outside the application. The cloud service provider sends an auth-token to the application after successful authorization and that token is used to make API calls.<br><br>

Auth-token is a digital key that allows third-party applications to interact with cloud storage. Auth-token is stored on your device in secure system storage called Keychain. You can download your files from the connected cloud service to the device and those files will be placed in the app "Documents" directory. You can remove that files anytime using the built-in file manager.<br>
The application does not share any information from the connected cloud account. You can revoke access to your cloud account anytime by opening the account settings page on your web browser.<br><br>

To reject auth-token login to your account on the web browser and navigate to the settings page. There you can find all third-party apps which are connected to your cloud account and remove any of them if you don’t want to use that application anymore.<br><br>

You can also disconnect the connected cloud accounts in the application and auth-token will be also removed from your device. If you remove the application from your device all downloaded data and access tokens will be also removed.<br><br>
