## Common Issues and Answers

<div class="hx:mt-6"></div>

<div class="hx:w-full">

{{% details title="Why can't I log in to pCloud on an older iOS version (15.8.4)?" closed="true" %}}
pCloud‚Äôs web login page may not display correctly on older iOS versions such as 15.8.4, which prevents entering your email and password inside cloud connection screen.<br><br>

As a workaround, you can use the **WebDAV** protocol, which is supported by pCloud and works reliably across all iOS versions.

**WebDAV Setup:**<br>
- **US Servers:** `https://webdav.pcloud.com`  
- **European Servers:** `https://ewebdav.pcloud.com`  
- **Username:** Your pCloud email address  
- **Password:** Your pCloud account password  

Open App ‚Üí Connections ‚Üí Connect to Cloud Storage ‚Üí Choose **WebDAV** ‚Üí Enter your credentials and server URL.

This method will let you connect to your pCloud storage and have access to your files without issues on older devices.
