When it comes to audio players, finding the right equalizer can make all the difference in your music-listening experience. Our audio apps, **Evermusic** and **Flacbox**, stand out as full-featured players equipped with a professional 10-band equalizer and a range of exciting features.

In a perfect world, where music files and headphones are flawless, an equalizer might seem unnecessary. However, our daily lives often involve less-than-ideal listening environments â€” commuting, working out, or strolling through noisy city streets. These situations, combined with the limitations of standard headphones, call for the power of EQ adjustments. An equalizer lets you fine-tune frequency balance, compensate for imperfect headphones or speakers, and adapt to background noise. Whether you're boosting bass and treble for a party vibe or fine-tuning sound for a DJ session, our equalizer offers creative audio enhancement to elevate your listening experience.

## How Does the Equalizer in Evermusic and Flacbox Work?

Our apps boast a powerful 10-band equalizer, offering precise control over specific sound frequencies. Here's how it works:

**Frequency Control:** The equalizer spans 10 different frequencies, ranging from 32 Hz to 16 kHz. Adjust the amplifier gain for each frequency using intuitive sliders.

**Presets:** Choose from a variety of predefined equalizer presets, including Acoustic, Bass Booster, Hip-Hop, Rock, and more.

**Create Your Own Presets:** Feeling creative? Craft and save your custom equalizer presets to match your unique preferences or audio equipment.

**Preamplifier Gain:** If your track lacks volume, use the preamplifier slider to boost the output and enjoy a louder, clearer sound.

**Audio Level Indicators:** Once the song is playing, you can check the output level indicators and adjust the preamplifier gain accordingly.
