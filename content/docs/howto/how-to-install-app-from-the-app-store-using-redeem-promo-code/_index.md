## What is a Redeem Promo Code?

A Redeem Promo Code is like a golden ticket that lets you install a paid app for free or unlock in-app purchases without spending a dime. To get one, you simply ask the app developer. Here's how to use it:

### If you have iOS 11 or higher:

1. Open the App Store on your iPhone or iPad and tap the "Today" tab at the bottom.

2. In the top right corner, tap the "Account" icon to access your "Account Settings."

If your Redeem Promo Code is for an in-app purchase, the steps are the same. After activating the code, open the app's "Settings" page and tap "Restore purchases" to activate your in-app purchase.

## For Mac Users:

The process is similar to iOS:

- Open the App Store on your Mac.
- Access the "Account" page and click the "Redeem Gift Card" button.
