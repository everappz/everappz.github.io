## Intro

Looking to personalize your Spotify music collection with custom album artwork? While Spotify doesn't let you change covers for its streaming catalog, you *can* update album covers for **local music files** added to your library.

In this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to **change album art for local tracks** in Spotify using both **mobile (iOS)** and **desktop (Mac)** apps. Whether you're fixing incorrect artwork or adding custom visuals to your MP3s, this guide will walk you through the process.

To make things easier, we'll show how to edit album artwork using the **Evertag** app — a powerful audio metadata editor that supports **over 120 audio tags** and **30+ file formats**. It's perfect for updating ID3 tags and album art on your iPhone or Mac.

## Download the App

Start by downloading the **Evertag** app from the App Store. It’s free to use and available on both **iOS** and **macOS**.

## Activate Local Library in Spotify

By default, the **Local Files Library** is disabled in the Spotify app. If you want Spotify to show and play music files stored directly on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, you’ll need to activate this feature first. Here’s how to enable it step by step:

### Open the Spotify App

{{< cards cols="1">}}

{{< card title="" subtitle="Grant Spotify Access to Music Files" image="/spotify-access-to-music.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

### Check Spotify Folder

Once permission is granted, open the **Files app**, go to **Locations > On My iPhone/iPad**, and find the **Spotify** folder. This is where local music files should be placed.

{{< /cards >}}

## Put Music Files into Spotify's Local Library Folder

Now that you’ve enabled Spotify’s local library, you can transfer music files into the Spotify folder using two methods:
- **Via iTunes File Sharing** as shown in [this tutorial](/docs/howto/how-to-play-local-itunes-files-on-my-iphone/)
- **Using the native Files app**

Below are instructions using the **Files app** method.

### Open Files App – Locations – On This Device

## Connect Spotify Folder in the Evertag App

Now that your files are copied to the Spotify local folder, you might want to clean up their metadata and add proper album covers. To do that, use the **Evertag** app — available on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

With Evertag, you can manage audio metadata for:
- **Local files** (stored on your device)
- **Cloud files** (stored in Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

### Connect a Local Folder

You can edit metadata directly from folders without importing the files.

#### iOS

- Tap **Connect a Folder**
- In the file picker, choose the **Spotify folder** and tap **Open**
- Once added, tap the folder to view its contents

#### macOS / iPadOS

- Scroll to **Files On This Device** in the sidebar

{{< cards cols="1">}}

- Tap **Connect a Folder**

1. **File Manager**
   - Tap **More actions (•••)** > **Select files** > **Edit audio tags**

## Update Spotify Library

{{< /cards >}}

Open the **Local Files** section again. You should now see updated artwork and tags for your local tracks.

> If updates don't show immediately, **force-close Spotify** and reopen it. This triggers a metadata refresh.
