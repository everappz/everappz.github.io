### Connect Your Dropbox

Once Evermusic is installed, open the **Connections** tab → **Connect a cloud service**, select **Dropbox** from the list of available cloud accounts, and add your account. You can authorize using the native app or a web form with login and password. This connection is secure, and Evermusic does not access your account or data.

## Enjoy Your Music

Connect unlimited cloud accounts. Evermusic scans connected storages for audio files (MP3, WAV, and more), and all found tracks appear in the **Music Library** tab. Just tap to play.

### Enhance Your Listening Experience

Evermusic features a built-in 10-band equalizer with presets, preamplifier, and bass booster. Audiobook fans can use **audio bookmarks** and **playback speed** controls. There's also a **sleep timer**, lock screen controls, and streaming support for **Google Chromecast** and **Apple TV**.

## Download for Offline Playback

### Offline Access

Download your favorite tracks for offline playback by selecting **Download** in the options menu.
