## Step 1: Getting Started with Evermusic (for Standard Audio Formats) or Flacbox (for Lossless Music)

To begin your journey into the world of local music on your iPhone and Mac, start by installing either Evermusic (for standard audio formats like mp3 and wav) or Flacbox (for lossless music in dsd and flac). Both of these apps are available for iOS and MacOS, and you can download them for free.

## Step 2: Playing Local Files Located on Your Device

Once you've installed the application, open the "Local Files" screen and scroll down to the "Files on this iPhone" section. From there, choose "Open files..." if you need to select several audio files or "Open folder..." if you want to pick a music folder. The app will scan the folder's content, and all found audio files will be selected.

{{< figure src="21260c_ec30fd738d6b46eb9dba21f51c7f1f3e~mv2.png" alt="evermusic local files screen" width="400" >}}

On the next screen, tap the "Browse" item on the bottom tab bar and scroll to the "Locations" section. Select the "On My iPhone" menu item.

{{< figure src="21260c_67b3f80c255b4be59588bfab8d978588~mv2.png" alt="system files picker" width="400" >}}

After tapping "Open," a full-screen audio player will appear, and the files will be added to the player queue. These files will be played directly from the selected location without being copied to the application bundle. If you prefer to copy files to the application every time you open them, navigate to "Settings" - "File manager" - "Copy files during opening" and select "Always copy files during opening."
