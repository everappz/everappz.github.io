## Introduction:
There are moments when you find the need to add comments to your tracks and read them while a song is playing. Consider scenarios like learning a foreign language through audio lessons, where having textual information is essential. The good news is that in the latest version of Evermusic and Flacbox, you can add your comments to a track, and the app seamlessly displays them while the song is playing. This feature adds a new layer of interactivity, making your music experience even more personalized and versatile.

## How to Add Comments:
To start adding comments, simply utilize the built-in audio tags editor. While a track is playing, navigate to the audio player screen and tap the three dots button next to the track title.

## Timed Comments:
Take your comments to the next level by inserting time markers. Using the format [MM:SS.SS], you can ensure that your comments are highlighted precisely when the audio player reaches specific time intervals during playback. It's a dynamic way to engage with your music, providing context and insights at key moments.

```

## Switching Between Modes:

## Switching between Comments / Embedded Lyrics / LRC file:
Once you open the Comments screen, you can switch between three modes by swiping right: Comments, Embedded Lyrics, and LRC File.

1. **Comments Mode:** This displays the content from the COMMENT field of your audio file.
2. **Lyrics Mode:** This shows the embedded lyrics from your audio file. If your audio file has lyrics in the tags, they will appear here. This mode also supports timed text in LRC format. To edit the lyrics tag, use an external audio tag editor like Evertag. You can find LRC format lyrics for free on websites like [Lyricsify](https://www.lyricsify.com). Copy the needed lyrics to your tags and save them to display later on this screen.
3. **LRC File Mode:** Instead of editing audio files, you can place an LRC file in the same folder as the original audio file. Both files should have the same name but different extensions. When you swipe to the third page on the Comments screen, the app will search for the LRC file in the same directory and display its content.

This setup ensures you can easily view comments, lyrics, and LRC files for your audio tracks.

## Conclusion:
The addition of comments to audio tracks in Evermusic and Flacbox marks a significant leap in user engagement and personalization. Whether you're a music aficionado or a language learner, this feature empowers you to interact with your tracks in a whole new way. Dive into the world of personalized audio commentary and rediscover your music library with Evermusic and Flacbox. Enhance your music experience, one comment at a time.
