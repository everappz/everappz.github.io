**Modes:**

1. **Comments Mode:** Displays the content from the COMMENT field of your audio file.

2. **Lyrics Mode:** Shows the embedded lyrics from your audio file. If your audio file has lyrics in the tags, they will appear here. This mode also supports timed text in LRC format. To edit the lyrics tag, use an external audio tag editor like Evertag. You can find LRC format lyrics for free on websites like Lyricsify. Copy the needed lyrics to your tags and save them to display later on this screen.

3. **LRC File Mode:** Instead of editing audio files, you can place an LRC file in the same folder as the original audio file. Both files should have the same name but different extensions. When you swipe to the third page on the Comments screen, the app will search for the LRC file in the same directory and display its content.

You can also activate the quick Comments button on the main audio player screen and switch between artwork view, audio player queue view, and comments view by tapping the view mode button at the bottom of the audio player screen.
