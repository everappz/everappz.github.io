## Understanding the Display Modes

- **Comments Mode**:  
  Shows the content from the `COMMENT` field of your audio file.

- **Lyrics Mode**:  
  Displays embedded lyrics from tags. Timed text in LRC format is supported here. To edit lyrics, use a tag editor like **Evertag**. You can also find LRC content at websites like *Lyricsify*, copy it into your tag fields, and view it in this screen.

- **LRC File Mode**:  
  Instead of tagging the audio file, place a `.lrc` file with the **same filename** in the same folder as the audio file. The app will detect and display it automatically on this screen.

## Enable Quick Comments Access from Audio Player

You can switch between **Artwork**, **Queue**, and **Comments** views using the view toggle on the audio player screen.
