## Fixing streaming issues

Sometimes, you might face issues when streaming music from your iCloud folder. In this case, we recommend enabling the audio player cache. This feature will pre-download the next song while the current one is playing, ensuring smooth transitions without interruptions. To enable the audio player cache, go to Settings -> Audio Player -> Audio Player Cache -> Enable. You can also set the cache size so that old tracks are deleted, keeping the cache within the limit on your device.
