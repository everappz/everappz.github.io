## Introduction

If you have a **Mac, Windows PC, Linux machine, or NAS device**, you can easily transform it into a **personal music server** at home using [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/), a free and open-source media platform. With Kodi's built-in **DLNA/UPnP server**, you can stream your entire music library to any DLNA-compatible client â€” including your iPhone or iPad.

In this guide, weâ€™ll show you step-by-step how to:

- Install Kodi on your Mac or PC  
- Set up your music folders for sharing  
- Enable the DLNA music server  
- Access that music using the **Evermusic** or **Flacbox** iOS app

This setup is 100% free â€” no subscriptions, just your own music streamed over your Wi-Fi network. Whether you're trying to organize your large MP3 collection, listen to FLAC over Wi-Fi, or just enjoy your local music without syncing via iTunes, this setup is perfect for you.

## Download and Install Kodi on Your Mac / PC / Linux / NAS

Both apps are available for **iOS** and **macOS**, and free to use.
