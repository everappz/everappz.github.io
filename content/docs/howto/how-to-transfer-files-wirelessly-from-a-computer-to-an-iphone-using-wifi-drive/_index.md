Wi-Fi Drive is the easiest way to transfer your files from the computer to an iPhone or iPad without iTunes. You can easily download or upload multiple files or even folders using a local Wi-Fi connection. Both devices should be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

You can transfer files wirelessly using a desktop web browser or WebDAV client like Mac Finder or Windows File Explorer.

8. After the connection is established you will see the file manager web app. All common operations are supported. You can Copy, Move, Delete, Upload, and Download your files from the computer to the local storage of your device. Use the drag & drop or the Upload button to transfer music to your iPhone. Additionally, if your device is connected to your Mac using a cable, this can speed up file transfers. In this case, your Mac will set up a virtual online server, but the connection will utilize the cable for faster transfer speeds.

9. Tap "Stop Wi-Fi Drive" on the iPhone when you finished.

*Note: please make sure you use the latest version of the desktop browser and JavaScript is not disabled. This will fix any issues if the connection cannot be established.*
