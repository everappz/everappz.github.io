There's an array of personal NAS servers available on the market, each with its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Some may be more complex, while others are user-friendly. Western Digital has introduced one of the simplest personal network-attached storage solutions, the WD My Cloud Home.

## How to Play Music on iPhone from WD MyCloud EX2 Ultra, WD MyCloud Mirror, or Any Other WD MyCloud Storage

When you add a connection in the app through **Connections > Connect a Cloud Service > My Cloud Home**, it's designed to officially support WD MyCloud Home devices.

However, if you’ve been able to connect your WD MyCloud EX2 Ultra, WD MyCloud Mirror, or any other WD MyCloud Storage, here’s a workaround to help you use it.

To make this work, simply create a folder in the app’s file manager after connecting and upload your music files there. It appears WD’s server only allows access to app-created folders in a “sandbox mode” for these devices, so this folder will only be accessible from the Evermusic app.

Please use Evermusic’s file manager to upload your songs to this folder. Once the files are uploaded, you can delete the local copies from your device and listen directly from your NAS.

**Steps:** 

1. **Connect to WD MyCloud Storage:** Go to *Connections > Connect a Cloud Service > My Cloud Home*.
2. **Create a Folder:** On the connected cloud service (visible only in the app).
3. **Upload Music Files:** Upload your local audio files from your device to this folder.
4. **Delete Local Files:** Once uploaded, delete the originals from your device if needed.
5. **Start Streaming:** Play any uploaded media file directly from the folder.
