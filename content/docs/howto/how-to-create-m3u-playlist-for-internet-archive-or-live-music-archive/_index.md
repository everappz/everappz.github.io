In this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to generate and download M3U playlists from [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) items ‚Äî including the **Live Music Archive** ‚Äî using a simple, browser-based tool.

## What Is the Internet Archive?

The [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) is a non-profit digital library offering millions of free books, movies, software, music, and more. Among its audio collections is the **Live Music Archive**, which includes thousands of high-quality concert recordings, available in formats like **FLAC**, **24-bit FLAC**, **MP3**, and **OGG** ‚Äî all completely free to access and download.

## Open the M3U Generator Tool

Start by visiting the M3U playlist generator website:

üëâ [https://archivetom3u.com](https://archivetom3u.com)

This free tool allows you to paste any Internet Archive item URL and instantly generate a playable `.m3u` file ‚Äî no signup or software installation required.

## How the Tool Works

The tool uses the official Internet Archive Metadata API to retrieve track listings and generate playlist files. No media is hosted or mirrored by the site. You can also preview tracks directly in your browser using the built-in player.

## Supported Audio Formats

You can choose from the following formats:
- **VBR MP3**
- **FLAC**
- **24-BIT FLAC**
- **OGG VORBIS**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only tracks available in your selected format will be included in the generated playlist.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
