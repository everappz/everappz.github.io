## Enabling Offline Mode for Automatic Sync

1. **Activate Offline Mode:**
   - Instead of just downloading, enable offline mode to automatically update local files when changes occur on the cloud service (e.g., file updates or new files added).

   - Offline mode performs a one-way sync, reflecting only cloud service changes in your local copy.

4. **Settings for Downloads:**

## Managing Synchronized Offline Folders

1. **Folder Management:**
   - In the Synchronized Offline Folders section, you can start and stop sync, show a folder in its enclosing directory, or disable offline mode (which removes local copies of files from your device).

2. **Set Sync Interval:**
   - Configure the sync interval for offline folders (default is 1 day) to automatically check for updates and sync local copies when the app is opened.

## Using Audio Player Cache

The last option for downloading cloud files is using the audio player cache. Here's how it works: enable the audio player cache in the app settings (Audio Player > Audio Player Cache).

- Set the cache size so old files are automatically removed, and new files are downloaded to the Local Files > Audio Player folder. When you start playing music from the cloud, the app will automatically pre-download the next track in the queue, ensuring smooth transitions between tracks.

1. **Enable Audio Player Cache:**
   - Go to Settings - Audio Player - Audio Player Cache to enable the cache.
   - Set the cache size so old files are automatically removed and new files are downloaded to Local Files - Audio Player folder.
   - When playing music from the cloud, the app will pre-download the next track to ensure smooth transitions.

2. **Check Cache Location:**
   - Verify the audio player cache location by selecting **Show in Folder** on the settings screen.

## Avoiding Duplicate Files

The app offers several options for downloading files: Offline Mode, Direct Download, and Audio Player Cache. To avoid duplicates, use only one method. Additionally, if a track is in multiple collections (such as albums or playlists) and you enable Offline Mode for both, the track will be downloaded twice, as Offline Mode functions independently for each collection.

1. **Manage Multiple Copies:**
   - Avoid having multiple copies of the same file by using the **Show in Folder** option to locate files and manage duplicates.

## Troubleshooting and Tips

1. **Multiple Copies of Files:**
   - Be aware that enabling multiple download modes (e.g., audio player cache, folder download, offline mode for cloud folders, playlists, albums, artists) can result in duplicate files. Use **Show in Folder** to locate and manage these files.

2. **Background Transfers:**
   - Ensure background transfers are enabled in settings to keep downloads running even when the app is not active.

3. **Syncing Intervals:**
   - Adjust syncing intervals in settings to ensure your music library is always up to date with the latest changes from your cloud service.

By following these detailed steps, you can seamlessly manage and play your local and cloud-stored music offline using Evermusic and Flacbox. Enjoy uninterrupted access to your music library, organized and ready to play whenever you want.
