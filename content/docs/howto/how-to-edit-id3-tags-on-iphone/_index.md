## Intro

In this tutorial, we will learn how to edit your audio tags on iPhone or Mac using the built-in tag editor in the Evermusic or Flacbox app. Evermusic and Flacbox allow you to connect to your cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and even your home computer, TimeCapsule, or NAS. With the ability to download songs, albums, and artists for offline playback at your convenience, your music is always at your fingertips.

When you import songs into your music library, they are intelligently grouped by artists, albums, and genres. This makes it vital to keep your songs' metadata updated. With accurate metadata, you can locate any song, album, or artist in your music library.

While many desktop apps offer metadata editing, Evermusic and Flacbox take simplicity to the next level by including an ID3 tag editor. Now, you can use one app to build your music library, enjoy your tracks, and fix audio tags.

## Choose 'Edit Audio Tags'

## Smart Autocomplete  

You can also utilize the smart autocomplete feature by tapping the 'Auto-Search Audio Tags' button. This helps correct spelling errors and adds missing information. Imagine you only remember the artist and track name but not the album name – simply fill in the known fields (mistakes are allowed) and tap the 'Auto-Search Audio Tags' button. The app will use an online database to find missing tags for your track and fill in the gaps.

## Automatic Upload  

When you close the tags editor, the app will automatically upload the edited audio file back to the cloud, ensuring your library stays up to date.

## Edit Local Files

You can edit audio tags for files stored **directly on your device** — without importing them into the app.

- **Go to the "Local Files" section**, then scroll down to **"Files On This Device."**

{{< cards cols="1">}}
{{< card title="" subtitle="More Actions - Local File" image="/more_actions_local_file.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

- The Tag Editor will open. Make your changes and tap **"Save"**. That’s it! Your edits are applied directly to the file — no need to copy it back or move anything around.

### Auto-Search Audio Tags

This action activates the smart tag search engine, which finds and fills in complete metadata for your audio file based on the existing information.  
The app uses the MusicBrainz database — one of the most comprehensive tag databases — with over **50 million** tracks.

### Search Album Artwork

Use metadata to search the web for the correct album artwork. Once found, save the image to your **Photos** using the system context menu. After that, return to the tag editor, tap the Camera icon, go to **Photos Library**, and select the saved image. The app will set it as the cover for your audio file. You can adjust how cover images are scaled in the app’s settings.

### Normalize Encoding

This action will normalize the text encoding of all tags in the audio file’s metadata. It’s especially helpful if you're switching from a Windows PC, where files may use different encodings that appear as unreadable or garbled characters on a Mac.

### Delete Audio Tags

Clear all metadata fields for a file. Useful when starting from scratch. Tap **Save** to confirm.

## Tag Editor Settings

Navigate to **Settings → Tag Editor** to customize behavior.

### Album Cover Scaling

Select how album covers should be scaled when saved into audio files. You can disable scaling to keep the original image size, but be aware that some players may not support large artwork files.

### Update Online Files

You can control how the app updates metadata for audio files stored in cloud services:

- **Show confirmation message**  
Ask before applying metadata changes to cloud files.

- **Automatically update file's metadata**  
Save metadata changes to the cloud file automatically after editing.

- **Do not update file's metadata**  
Skip updating cloud files—changes will apply only locally.

### Edit Online Files

Choose what happens to locally downloaded copies of cloud files after editing:

- **Always delete downloaded file**  
  Remove the local copy after saving changes.

- **Do not delete downloaded file**  
  Keep the downloaded file on your device after editing.

### Main Screen Buttons

Customize which actions appear on the main screen of the tag editor. Enable or disable specific buttons to tailor the interface to your workflow.
