Unlock the power of seamless music library management with Evermusic and Flacbox. These apps allow you to connect to your cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and even your home computer, TimeCapsule, or NAS. With the ability to download songs, albums, and artists for offline playback at your convenience, your music is always at your fingertips.

When you import songs into your music library, they are intelligently grouped by artists, albums, and genres. Album artworks are automatically loaded using metadata from your tracks. This makes it vital to keep your songs' metadata updated. With accurate metadata, you can effortlessly locate any song, album, or artist in your music library.

While many desktop apps offer metadata editing, Evermusic and Flacbox take simplicity to the next level by including an ID3 tags editor. Now, you can use one app to build your music library, enjoy your tunes, and fine-tune audio tags.

## How to Edit ID3 Tags

The app will use an online database to find missing tags for your track and fill in the gaps.
