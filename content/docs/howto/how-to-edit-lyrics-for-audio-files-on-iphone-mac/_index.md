## Intro

In this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to edit **Unsynced Lyrics** and **Lyrics Advisory Rating** in audio tags for your music files. Once updated, these lyrics will be visible in any music player that supports the lyrics tag such as **Evermusic** or **Flacbox**.

To demonstrate, we‚Äôll use the **Evertag** app. It supports **120+ audio tags**, **30+ audio formats**, and includes powerful **batch editing** features. If you're looking for a full-featured tag management tool for iPhone or Mac, **Evertag** is your best choice.

## Download the App

Start by downloading the **Evertag** app from the App Store. It's available for both **iOS** and **macOS**, and free to use.

## Connect Your Cloud Account 

You can edit audio tags for both **Local files** stored on your device and **Cloud files** stored in connected cloud accounts. In cloud storage mode, the app will automatically download the file from your cloud service, allow you to edit the tags, and then upload the updated version back to the cloud once editing is complete. You can also choose whether to delete the temporary local copy after editing.

To connect a cloud storage service:

- Go to the **Connections**

- Tap **Connect to Cloud Storage**

## Editing Modes

Evertag provides two editing modes:

- **Single-file mode**  
  - Navigate between files by swiping left or right on the artwork carousel.  

- **Batch mode**  
  - Edit multiple files at once and apply shared metadata.  
  - To activate, scroll to the bottom and tap **Edit several files simultaneously**.

## Single-File Mode

By default, the app opens the tag editor in single-file mode with only the main editing options enabled. In this mode, you can edit the most common metadata fields, such as: Track Title, Subtitle, Album Artist, Album, Artist, Composer, Performer, Genre, Comment, Beats Per Minute, Podcast, Compilation, Disc Number, Track Number, Track Total, Rating, Year.

To access all available tags, scroll to the bottom of the screen and tap the **Show Extended Tags** option. This will switch the editor to extended mode, allowing you to edit over **120 metadata fields**, including **MusicBrainz Tags**, **Lyrics**, **Advisory Ratings**, and more.

   - Tap **Select**, choose multiple files, and then tap **Edit audio tags**.

2. **From Tag Editor**  
   - Open any file, scroll to the bottom, and tap **Edit files simultaneously** to load all files from the same folder.

## Edit Lyrics

> Audio files that support **ID3 tags** (such as `.mp3` or `.wav`) allow you to add lyrics in multiple languages. If you are editing an ID3-tagged file, Evertag enables full multi-language support.  
> For other formats (e.g., FLAC, M4A), only a single lyrics entry is supported. After tapping the **Lyrics Unsynced** field, you'll be able to add or edit the lyrics content.

### Add a New Page (ID3 Tags Only)

If you're editing ID3 tags, the next screen will show an **Add New Page** button. Tap it to begin adding a new lyrics entry.

### Set the Lyrics Advisory Rating

Optionally, update the **Lyrics Advisory Rating** using the segmented control. This setting helps music players and libraries mark tracks as explicit or clean.

| Value | Symbol | Label           | Description                                           |
|-------|--------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | ‚Äì      | Not Rated        | No advisory rating has been assigned.                |
| 1     | üÖí     | Clean Lyrics     | Content is labeled as clean; safe for all audiences. |
| 2     | üÖî     | Explicit Lyrics  | Contains explicit lyrics or adult content.           |

## Conclusion

By following these steps, your lyrics will be properly embedded into the audio file's metadata and visible in compatible apps like **Evermusic**, **Flacbox**, and others.
