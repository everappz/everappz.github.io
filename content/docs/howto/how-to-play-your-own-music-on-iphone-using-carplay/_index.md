{{< card title="" subtitle="CerPlay Main Menu" image="/library-with-images.webp" imageStyle="border-radius: clamp(14px, 2vw, 28px);" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

## Library

The **Library** tab in Evermusic is the central hub where all your music is organized. Once you've added tracks to your library—whether from cloud storage, local files, or iTunes—the app automatically reads their metadata and neatly groups them into categories like **Albums**, **Artists**, **Genres**, and more.

This screen gives you quick access to your favorites, recents, playlists, bookmarks, and all added tracks. You can also continue playback from your last session, view unplayed songs, and explore music by tags or source type.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
{{< card title="" subtitle="Library" image="/library-with-images-3.webp" imageStyle="border-radius: clamp(14px, 2vw, 28px);" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

The **Library** section contains the following categories:

- **Continue Playback** – Resume your last playlist or song queue  
- **Favorites** – Tracks you've marked with a star  
- **Recents** – Your recently played songs  
- **Unplayed Songs** – Tracks you've added but haven’t played yet  
- **Bookmarks** – Saved positions in long audio files  
- **Playlists** – Your custom and auto-generated collections  
- **Songs** – All songs grouped by title  
- **Albums** – Grouped by album name  
- **Album Artists** – Grouped by album artist metadata  
- **Artists** – Grouped by artist tag  
- **Genres** – Based on embedded genre info  
- **Composers** – Organized by composer metadata  
- **Files in This Application** – Offline files stored in the app  
- **Files on This iPhone** – Manually imported tracks from the Files app  
- **iTunes Music** – Music from your iPod library (excluding Apple Music)

You can open any submenu and tap a track to start playback instantly. For more in-depth details, check the full [Music Library Guide](/docs/guide/evermusic/evermusic-guide-music-library/).


## Connections

The **Connections** tab is your central hub for accessing and managing all connected cloud storage services, local network devices.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
{{< card title="" subtitle="Connections" image="/connections-with-images-3.webp" imageStyle="border-radius: clamp(14px, 2vw, 28px);" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

From here, you can connect to popular cloud platforms like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, MEGA, iCloud Drive, and even network drives like SMB, DLNA, and WebDAV. Once connected, you can browse, stream, download, and manage files directly from within the app.

The **Connections** screen includes the following sections:

- **Favorite Files** – Quickly access folders or files you’ve marked as favorites for fast navigation, especially useful in CarPlay.
- **Recently Opened Files** – View the most recent files you’ve accessed from your connected services.
- **Cloud Storages** – Manage all your connected cloud services and local network drives.

You can connect new cloud services using the **“Connect to Cloud Storage”** option on the main Connections screen. Once connected, you can navigate into folders, browse music libraries, and even stream or download tracks on the go. If a folder is deeply nested, you can **mark it as a Favorite** for easy access later — particularly helpful for CarPlay users who want quick navigation.

You can also use **Wi-Fi Drive** or **iTunes File Sharing** to import music from your computer wirelessly or via USB. Support for connecting to NAS devices, external drives, and local networks gives you full control over how you store and access your music.

To learn more about all the ways to connect and manage your cloud and network libraries, read the full [Connections Guide](/docs/guide/evermusic/evermusic-guide-connections/).

## Local Files

The **Local Files** section is your central hub for managing audio files stored directly on your device or inside the Evermusic app’s **Documents** directory. It also includes offline files downloaded from cloud storage, audio player cache files, and folders you've made available for offline playback. This section ensures you can enjoy your music library even without an internet connection.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
{{< card title="" subtitle="Local Files" image="/local-files-with-images.webp" imageStyle="border-radius: clamp(14px, 2vw, 28px);" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

The **Local Files** screen is organized into the following key sections:

- **Favorite Files** – Shortcuts to folders or files you’ve marked as favorites. Especially useful for CarPlay or quick access.
- **Recently Opened Files** – Tracks and folders you've opened recently from local storage.
- **Documents** – Displays all files and folders located in the app’s internal Documents directory. This includes items added via cloud downloads, Wi-Fi Drive, iTunes File Sharing, or USB transfers.
- **Offline Folders** – Shows all folders you've marked for offline use (e.g., cloud folders, albums, playlists, or artist collections downloaded for offline playback).
- **iCloud** – Displays content synchronized via iCloud Drive, ensuring access across all devices.
- **Device Folders** – Folders located outside the app on your iPhone/iPad. These are added manually via the system file picker or folder connection.
- **Audio Player** – A cache folder used for crossfade and performance optimization. Can be disabled or cleared in settings.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
{{< card title="" subtitle="Device Folders in Local Files" image="/local-files-device-folders.webp" imageStyle="border-radius: clamp(14px, 2vw, 28px);" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

You can learn more in the full [Local Files Guide](/docs/guide/evermusic/evermusic-guide-local-files/).

## Folder View

{{< cards cols="1">}}
{{< card title="" subtitle="Local Folder with Covers" image="/local-folder-with-images-2.webp" imageStyle="border-radius: clamp(14px, 2vw, 28px);" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

When you open a folder, you'll find a set of handy actions at the top:

- **Play All** – Adds all audio files in the current folder (and subfolders) to the player queue.
- **Shuffle All** – Adds the same files in random order.
- **Continue Playback** – Resume playback from the last saved position if enabled in app settings.

## Content Depth Limit

{{< cards cols="1">}}
{{< card title="" subtitle="Content Depth Limit" image="/content-depth-limit.webp" imageStyle="border-radius: clamp(14px, 2vw, 28px);" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

When using CarPlay, you may encounter a **"Content Depth Limit"** error — especially if your music library has many deeply nested folders.  
This happens due to limitations in the CarPlay system, which restricts how many levels of folders it can display.

**How to Fix It**

To avoid this issue and access your music faster:

- **Add deeply nested folders to Favorites**  
  This makes them easily accessible directly from the **Favorites** menu in CarPlay.

- **Simplify your folder structure**  
  If possible, try flattening your folder hierarchy for smoother CarPlay navigation.

This workaround ensures a seamless experience when browsing your music in the car.

## Now Playing Screen

{{< cards cols="1">}}
{{< card title="" subtitle="CarPlay Now Playing Entry" image="/carplay-nowplaying.webp" imageStyle="border-radius: clamp(14px, 2vw, 28px);" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

After tapping on any audio file, it’s automatically added to the **player queue**.  
To view and control playback, simply tap the **Now Playing** icon located in the top-right corner of the CarPlay screen.

The **Now Playing** screen includes:

- Full playback controls (play, pause, next, previous)  
- Track title, artist, and album artwork  
- Playback modes such as **Repeat**, **Shuffle**, and **Playback Speed** adjustment

This screen lets you stay in control of your listening experience while driving — safely and efficiently.

## Settings
