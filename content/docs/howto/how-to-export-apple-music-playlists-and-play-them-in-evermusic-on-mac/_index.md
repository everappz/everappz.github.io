Apple Music on macOS allows you to create playlists not only from your Apple Music library but also from audio files located directly on your device.  
This is perfect if you want to organize your local collection of MP3, FLAC, or other audio files into playlists.  

In this tutorial, you will learn how to **export playlists from Apple Music on your Mac** and then import them into the **Evermusic** or **Flacbox** app.  
This way, you can continue listening to your favorite playlists with advanced features—without the need to recreate them from scratch.

## Exporting a Playlist from Apple Music

Start by opening the playlist in the Apple Music app on your Mac.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Open the playlist in Apple Music" image="1-apple-music-playlist.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Go to **File → Library → Export Playlist** from the top menu.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Export the playlist from your Library" image="2-library-export-playlist.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Choose the destination where the M3U file will be saved.  

> We recommend saving the M3U file in your **Music folder**. 
> This ensures that all the file paths are consistent, and the import process in Evermusic or Flacbox will work smoothly.  
> Because the apps run in sandbox mode on macOS, both the **playlist file** and the **media files** must be in the same folder for successful import.

## Importing the Playlist into Evermusic or Flacbox

Download one of the apps from the Mac App Store:

{{< cards cols="1">}}
{{< card link="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1564384601?pt=95781850&ct=everappzcom&mt=8" title="Evermusic" icon="download" tag="Free" >}}
{{< card link="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1594027432?pt=95781850&ct=everappzcom&mt=8" title="Flacbox" icon="download" tag="Free" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Open the **Playlists tab** in the app.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Open Playlists in Evermusic" image="4-evermusic-playlists.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Tap the **Add** button and select **Import Playlist**.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Import the playlist in Evermusic" image="5-evermusic-import-playlist.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Next, choose **Files on this Mac** to import files stored locally.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Select the import location in Evermusic" image="6-evermusic-select-location.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Now, connect your **Music folder** (where you saved the M3U playlist).  
This is necessary because macOS requires you to explicitly grant apps access to your files.

> **Note:** Due to macOS security policies, the application can only access folders you select.  
> Make sure the playlist file and the associated media files are in the same folder.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Choose Files on This Mac" image="7-files-on-this-mac.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Select your **Music folder** (where you saved the M3U playlist) and tap **Open** to confirm selection.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Select your Music folder" image="8-select-music-folder-location.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Once connected, open the folder and select your exported **M3U file**.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Select the M3U file" image="9-select-m3u-file.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

The app will begin importing all tracks from the playlist.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Wait while the playlist is importing" image="10-importing-playlist.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Once finished, you’ll see your playlist ready to use.  

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Playlist imported successfully" image="11-playlist-imported.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Tap on it to view its contents or start playback immediately.

## Archiving and Transferring Playlists

Evermusic and Flacbox offer advanced playlist management features.  
One of them is the ability to archive a playlist into a **ZIP file**, which includes the playlist file and all the tracks.  
This makes transferring playlists to another device quick and reliable.

Simply choose **More Actions → Add to Archive** from the playlist menu.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Open more actions for the playlist" image="14-more-actions-playlist.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

After selecting **Add to Archive**, wait a short moment while the app processes the playlist.  
Once the archiving is completed, you will see a **success alert**. Tap **Show File** to let the app reveal the newly created ZIP archive.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Archiving completed" image="15-archiving-completed.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

The app will then open the **Export folder**, where all created archives are stored.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Open the export folder" image="16-export-folder.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Locate your newly created archive, tap the **More Actions** button next to it, and choose **Show in Finder**.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Use More Actions on the ZIP file" image="17-more-actions-menu-zip-file.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

You will now see the **real location of the ZIP file** on your Mac.  
At this point, you can easily transfer the archive to another device.  
But before that, let’s take a closer look at what’s inside. Double-click the file to unarchive it.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Reveal the ZIP file in Finder" image="18-zip-file-revealed-in-finder.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Inside, you will find the **full playlist content**—all audio files included in the playlist, as well as the **M3U playlist file**.

{{< cards cols="1">}}
  {{< card title="" subtitle="Unarchive the ZIP file" image="19-unarchived-zip-file.webp" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Finally, open the **M3U file** to inspect its contents.  
It is formatted correctly, so when you move this ZIP archive to another device and unarchive it, you’ll be able to import the playlist seamlessly.  
The app will restore the playlist with the **correct track order** and **all associated media files**.
