## Introduction

The Local Files section serves as a hub for managing files located in the application's "Documents" folder, as well as files added from your device, which are available offline.

This built-in file manager allows you to edit files and offers various methods to import audio files into the app.

## Download files from cloud storage

You can add audio files to the app by downloading them from connected cloud storage services as described [here](/docs/howto/how-to-upload-my-files-to-the-cloud-storage-and-connect-them-to-evermusic-flacbox-evertag).

## Import files from your device

Easily import files from your device as described [here](/docs/howto/how-to-play-local-music-stored-on-your-iphone-or-mac), or from an attached USB drive as described [here](/docs/howto/how-to-connect-a-usb-flashcard-to-the-iphone-and-listen-to-music-or-manage-files-located-on-it).

## iTunes File Sharing

Transfer files using a cable connection as described [here](/docs/howto/how-to-transfer-files-from-my-mac-to-iphone-or-ipad-using-finder).

## Wi-Fi Drive

Transfer files wirelessly as described [here](/docs/howto/how-to-transfer-files-wirelessly-from-a-computer-to-an-iphone-using-wifi-drive).

## Transfers Queue

In the top left corner of the navigation bar, you'll find a 'Transfers' button. Tap it to access the transfers queue, where you can monitor and manage all your downloads and uploads. Additionally, you have the flexibility to adjust the transfer queue speed and network type in the app settings.

## Top Toolbar

The top toolbar, located under the navigation bar, offers several actions:

- **Search:** Perform a search within the current folder.  

You can show or hide the top toolbar using a swipe-down gesture.

## Special Folders

Within the "Local Files" screen, you'll encounter several special folders.

## Downloads

All files downloaded from a cloud storage service will appear here by default. You can customize this behavior in the application settings.

## iCloud

Place files in this folder, and they will sync across all your devices connected to the same iCloud account.

## Two Distinct Sections

The "Local Files" screen is organized into two distinct sections.

## Files in this Application

Shows files and folders stored in the appâ€™s Documents directory and iCloud Drive.

## Files on this iPhone/iPad/Mac

Shows files located on your device but in different applications. You can import them into this application using the system file picker. To activate the picker, choose "Open files..." to select files or "Open folders..." to select folders. Detailed instructions on how to import local music stored on your iPhone or Mac are available [here](/docs/howto/how-to-play-local-music-stored-on-your-iphone-or-mac). You can also connect a folder located on your device and have quick access to the folder's content. Use the "Connect a folder" menu item and choose a folder located on your device. Tap "Done," and the app will create a link to that folder with read/write access, allowing you to manage files directly from this app. To disconnect a folder located on your device, tap the "More Actions" button and choose "Disconnect."
