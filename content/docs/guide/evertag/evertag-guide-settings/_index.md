## Upgrade to Premium

Upgrade the application to the Premium version to remove all limits. The free version of the application offers one-lifetime in-app purchase and two subscription options that allow you to remove all restrictions and upgrade to the Premium version.  

Also, please keep in mind that **Family Sharing** is enabled for all purchases and plans, so you can share the Premium version with members of your family.  

You can read more about purchases and Premium version here: [What is the difference between Evertag and Evertag Premium](/docs/faq/evertag/what-is-the-difference-between-evertag-and-evertag-premium/).

## Sharing Purchases Between iOS and Mac

Please keep in mind that lifetime purchases and subscriptions are shared between iOS and Mac, using iCloud to sync this information. If you have the premium version on your iOS device, please ensure you have the latest version installed and that iCloud is enabled. Start the app on iOS and wait one minute for your purchase information to upload to iCloud.

You can also try pressing the "Restore Purchases" button in the app settings. Afterward, install the latest app version from the App Store on your Mac and start the app. Ensure you have an internet connection and are using the same iCloud and App Store account on your Mac that you used on your iOS device. Wait one minute for the app to download purchase info from iCloud. The premium version should activate on your Mac automatically.

## Restore purchases on a New Device

To restore your purchase on the new device just use the **Purchases -> Restore purchases** menu. You will see the list of your purchases. If you don't see all your purchases please check if the device is connected to the same iTunes account that was used to make purchases, and make sure iCloud is enabled.

## Try Premium for Free 

You can upgrade to the Premium version for free but for a limited time only using this menu. Just watch an advertisement or tell your friends about this app to get the Premium version for free.

## Purchases 

You can restore previous purchases from this menu. If you encounter activation errors, try enabling the “Restore Purchases at App Launch” option.

## What’s new
