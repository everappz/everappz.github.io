## Introduction

In the Playlists section, you’ll find helpful tools to manage your music collections. This area shows all your playlists in one place. At the top, there’s a "..." button in the navigation bar that opens a menu with different playlist options. You’ll also see a toolbar with quick actions like "Search," "Play all," and "Shuffle all." Each playlist also has its own "..." button next to its title, giving you more options just for that playlist.

## Creating a Playlist

Creating a new playlist is a straightforward process. You have two options: either tap the "+" button or the "..." button located in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar. Following this, select "New playlist" and give your playlist a meaningful name. Once you've provided a name, tap "Save."

![Creating a Playlist](21260c_7d04499d811f4485a84a94be7a480195~mv2.png)

This action triggers the "Add songs" dialog, where you can meticulously handpick the tracks you wish to include in your freshly minted playlist. These tracks are conveniently categorized by their source type, providing you with several options:

- **Library:** for tracks sourced from your music library.
- **Files in this application:** all audio files accessible for offline playback and located in Documents folder of this app (these can be added via downloads from cloud storage, imports from WiFi Drive, or using iTunes File Sharing).
- **Files on this device:** all audio files located on your device but not in this application.
- **Connections:** containing online files located within your connected cloud storage services.

It's important to note that, by default, you can add a single track to a playlist just once. However, if you desire the ability to include duplicate songs within a playlist, you can activate this feature in the app **Settings - Music library - Playlists - Duplicates in a playlist - Enable**.

## Import Playlist

In Flacbox, we’ve added M3U/CUE file import functionality, so you don’t have to create playlists manually.

![Import Playlist](21260c_b8e7f1fbae09458abcd1616faf11d9e9~mv2.png)

First, go to the ‘Playlists’ section. Then, tap the ‘More’ button in the top right corner. From the menu that appears, select the ‘Import Playlist’ option.

On the next screen, choose the file location. Supported options include:

- Connected cloud storage
- Files in the application
- Files on your device

![Choose File Location](21260c_ff428a191ca9480c8997f25cc315c0e1~mv2.png)

Let’s select connected cloud storage and open the folder containing the playlist file. Supported playlist file extensions include M3U, M3U8, and CUE. Select the playlist file and tap ‘Done’ to confirm your selection.

The app will parse the playlist file, create a list of tracks, and locate those files on the storage to compile a final playlist, which will be imported into the music library. It’s crucial that your M3U/CUE file contains the correct paths for media files, and the files should be located at those paths on your storage. You can read more about playlist import [here](/docs/howto/how-to-import-m3u-playlist-to-evermusic-and-flacbox).

## Playlist Detail Screen

When you open a playlist, the "Playlist detail screen" appears. On this screen, you'll find a "..." button in the top right corner with playlist options and three buttons under the artwork image: "Search," "Continue playback", "Play all," and "Shuffle all." Additionally, there's an "Offline mode" checkbox.

- **Continue playback**: Restore playback position for this playlist.

- **Play all**: Add all tracks from the current playlist to the player queue.

## Accessibility

Our app is fully accessible with VoiceOver technology, ensuring every component has a well-designed label and description. When VoiceOver is active, the app translates the user interface to text mode, displaying only accessible and useful elements to improve navigation speed and convenience. You can also activate text mode in Settings > Accessibility > Text Mode.

For adjusting track position in a playlist with VoiceOver:

1. Open a playlist and tap the "More" button.
2. Select "Change Songs Order." The view will switch to editing mode.
3. Tap the reorder indicator icon near the track title to give it focus.
4. Double-tap the reorder indicator icon quickly. On the second tap, do not release your finger—hold it until you hear a sound indicating the cell is ready to be moved.
5. Now, you can move the cell to a new position.

Other components work as expected, using system-provided VoiceOver patterns.
