## Introduction

Within the Playlists section, you'll discover an array of tools to effectively manage your music collections. This area offers a visual showcase of all your curated playlists, complemented by a convenient "..." button located in the navigation bar, which provides access to a range of playlist-related functions. Additionally, a navigation toolbar graces the interface, offering you quick access to essential commands like "Search," "Play all," and "Shuffle all." Furthermore, each individual playlist comes equipped with its own "..." button adjacent to the playlist title, offering a unique set of actions tailored to that specific playlist.

## Creating a Playlist

Crafting a new playlist is a straightforward process. You have two options: either tap the "+" button or the "..." button situated in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar. Following this, select "New playlist" and give your playlist a meaningful name. Once you've provided a name, tap "Save."

This action triggers the "Add songs" dialog, where you can meticulously handpick the tracks you wish to include in your freshly minted playlist. These tracks are conveniently categorized by their source type, providing you with several options:

- **Music library:** for tracks sourced from your music library.
- **Local files:** encompassing all audio files accessible for offline playback (these can be added via downloads from cloud storage, imports from WiFi Drive, or using iTunes File Sharing).
- **Connections:** containing online files located within your connected cloud services.

It's important to note that, by default, you can add a single track to a playlist just once. However, if you desire the ability to include duplicate songs within a playlist, you can activate this feature in the app Settings - Music library - Playlists - Duplicates in a playlist - Enable.

## Import Playlist

In Flacbox, we’ve added M3U/CUE file import functionality, so you don’t have to create playlists manually.

![Import Playlist](21260c_b8e7f1fbae09458abcd1616faf11d9e9~mv2.png)

First, go to the ‘Playlists’ section. Then, tap the ‘More’ button in the top right corner. From the menu that appears, select the ‘Import Playlist’ option.

On the next screen, choose the file location. Supported options include:

- Connected cloud storage
- Files in the application
- Files on your device

![Choose File Location](21260c_ff428a191ca9480c8997f25cc315c0e1~mv2.png)

Let’s select connected cloud storage and open the folder containing the playlist file. Supported playlist file extensions include M3U, M3U8, and CUE. Select the playlist file and tap ‘Done’ to confirm your selection.

The app will parse the playlist file, create a list of tracks, and locate those files on the storage to compile a final playlist, which will be imported into the music library. It’s crucial that your M3U/CUE file contains the correct paths for media files, and the files should be located at those paths on your storage.

- **Search:** execute a search exclusively within the current playlist.
- **Play all:** seamlessly add all tracks from the playlist to the player queue.
- **Shuffle all:** shuffle the entire tracklist before integrating it into the audio player queue.

## Accessibility

Our app is fully accessible with VoiceOver technology, ensuring every component has a well-designed label and description. When VoiceOver is active, the app translates the user interface to text mode, displaying only accessible and useful elements to improve navigation speed and convenience. You can also activate text mode in Settings > Accessibility > Text Mode.

For adjusting track position in a playlist with VoiceOver:

1. Open a playlist and tap the "More" button.
2. Select "Change Songs Order." The view will switch to editing mode.
3. Tap the reorder indicator icon near the track title to give it focus.
4. Double-tap the reorder indicator icon quickly. On the second tap, do not release your finger—hold it until you hear a sound indicating the cell is ready to be moved.
5. Now, you can move the cell to a new position.

Other components work as expected, using system-provided VoiceOver patterns.
