![evermusic settings screen](21260c_9cc76041f09447d0b809e8d36f64fd95~mv2.png)

**Upgrade to Premium:** upgrade the application to the Premium version to remove all limits. The free version of the application offers one-lifetime in-app purchase and two subscription options that allow you to remove all restrictions and upgrade to the Premium version. Also, please keep in mind that **Family Sharing** is enabled for all purchases and plans, so you can share the Premium version with members of your family.

![evermusic upgrade to premium screen](21260c_913f4cc686614133bc794b87b65f825e~mv2.png)

**Sharing Purchases Between iOS and Mac:** Please keep in mind that lifetime purchases and subscriptions are shared between iOS and Mac, using iCloud to sync this information. If you have the premium version on your iOS device, please ensure you have the latest version installed and that iCloud is enabled. Start the app on iOS and wait one minute for your purchase information to upload to iCloud.

You can also try pressing the "Restore Purchases" button in the app settings. Afterward, install the latest app version from the App Store on your Mac and start the app. Ensure you have an internet connection and are using the same iCloud and App Store account on your Mac that you used on your iOS device. Wait one minute for the app to download purchase info from iCloud. The premium version should activate on your Mac automatically.

**Restore on a New Device:** To restore your purchase on the new device just use the "Restore purchases" menu. You will see the list of your purchases. If you don't see all your purchases please check if the device is connected to the same iTunes account that was used to make purchases, and make sure iCloud is enabled.

![general player settings screen](21260c_af5ca9a962bb4133a2155286f32fca00~mv2.png)

**Audio Player Settings:** To access settings, tap the "more" button on the player screen and choose "Settings." Here, you'll find various sections:

![audio player settings menu](21260c_5287929e77cb4f9b9c962b99df5f9f30~mv2.png)

**General:** These settings cover the fundamental aspects of the audio player, including the playback queue, audio output, and saving the player's state. Available options:

**Repeat Mode:** This setting lets you choose how the audio player behaves when a track finishes playing. You can select from various options:

- "Repeat all" – This replays all the tracks in your queue.
- "Repeat one" – It repeats only the current track.
- "Repeat Stop" – This pauses playback when the current track ends.
- "Repeat None" – It allows your queue to play through without repeating.

**Shuffle Mode:** This option randomizes the order of tracks in your queue, creating a new sequence for playback. You can turn it "Shuffle off" or "Shuffle on."

**Audio Codec:** You can change the audio codec used for playing tracks in the application. Your choices include:

- "System codec + FFMPEG" – This prioritizes the system's audio codec where possible, enhancing compatibility and stability during playback. Note that pitch correction and audio output sample rate adjustments may not be available.
- "FFMPEG" – This forces the use of the FFMPEG codec for all audio files, allowing you to tweak pitch correction and audio output sample rate.

**Audio Output Sample Rate:** Adjust the audio output sample rate to optimize sound quality. This feature is useful if you have an external DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) connected to your device. You can pick values like "44.1 KHz," "48 KHz," "64 KHz," "88.2 KHz," or "96 KHz."

**Audio Output Number of Channels:** If you're using a multichannel audio system with an external DAC, this setting allows you to specify the number of channels. Options include "Mono," "Stereo," "Center, Left, Right," "Center, Left, Right, Surround," "ITU BS.775-1," "5.1 Surround," and "SDDS."

**Audio Output Preferred IO Buffer Duration:** This option allows you to configure the input/output buffer duration for audio playback on your device. A typical value for input/output buffer duration to minimize latency while playing high-resolution audio is around 5 milliseconds (0.005 seconds). Keep in mind that the actual acceptable buffer size may vary depending on the specific hardware and software environment. It's essential to test different buffer durations on your target device and choose the one that provides the best compromise between low latency and stable audio playback without glitches.

**Audio Output Mode (iOS Only):** This feature is exclusive to iOS and enables you to configure an audio output mixed mode. It allows audio from the app to blend seamlessly with other applications. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://www.everappz.com/post/how-to-record-video-while-playing-music-on-iphone).

**Save Playback Position:** This option ensures that the application saves and restores the playback position for songs in your music library.

**Save Audio Player State:** When enabled, this feature preserves your audio player's state before you close the app. This makes it easy to pick up where you left off. To continue playback, tap the "Continue Playback" button located at the top of the screen when you re-open the app. You can also restore playback for individual files by tapping on the specific track.

Once you’ve enabled both of these features, open any folder, album, artist, or genre within Evermusic. You’ll notice a ‘Continue Playback’ button at the top of the screen, along with the last saved song playback position. To restore the playback progress, simply tap on the ‘Continue Playback’ button. If you want to restore playback for an individual file, tap on that specific file.

**Personalization:** allows you to customize the look of the audio player screen, change the available controls on the main screen of the audio player, lock screen, and status bar during audio playback, and configure skip time controls.

![personalization settings screen](21260c_e1dee3c68a554c5f9a46ab1c6c713e4e~mv2.png)

**Audio Player Screen Style:** You can configure the positioning of elements on the audio player screen. Possible values are Old Style, Classical Style, and Modern Style.

**Additional Elements:** This allows you to enable additional elements on the audio player screen. Enabling ‘Audio Format Info’ will show the now-playing track’s audio info above the artwork picture. Enabling the ‘Audio Volume Slider’ will show the audio output slider below the playback controls on the main screen of the audio player.

**Buttons on the Main Screen:** This allows you to configure which buttons should be visible on the main audio player screen by default. Possible values include Repeat and Shuffle Mode, Next and Previous Song, Skip Time, Sleep Timer, Google Chromecast, AirPlay and Bluetooth, Audio Equalizer, Search, Bookmarks, Speed, Add Bookmark, Add to Favorites, and Comments.

**Buttons on the Lock Screen:** You can set which controls should be enabled on the lock screen. Possible values are Skip Time, Add Bookmark, and Add to Favorites.

**Skip Time Buttons:** You can select the time interval for the ‘Skip Time’ buttons here.

**Song Loading:** During the song loading process, you can change the network type that app uses to load songs. Available options - "Wi-Fi", "Wi-Fi and Cellular data".

![synchronized online filders selection screen](21260c_408d9e170d1a45a8aee981de4a16a2ba~mv2.png)

**Preloading time:** Set buffering time interval. You may increase this value if you have a bad network connection.

**Use direct URL:** when this option is enabled a direct URL will be used to load the song if the server supports it. This can speed up song loading but may affect playback stability.

**Audio Equalizer:** This section is where you can customize the audio equalizer settings. You can read more about configuring audio equalizer [here](https://www.everappz.com/post/how-to-use-the-audio-equalizer-on-your-iphone-ipad-mac-with-evermusic-and-flacbox).

![audio player cache settings screen](21260c_d1430e6328994723916c9dead4d05b20~mv2.png)

**Playback Speed:** Adjust the playback speed of the audio player to your liking.

**Pitch Correction:** change pitch correction settings using the predefined values. You can also switch between predefined values and precise mode by tapping the button in the top right corner.

![crossfade playback screen](21260c_8b278d6d7fd54104b1655fdaf66b2a16~mv2.png)

**Audio Player Cache:** Songs in the audio player queue are automatically downloaded to ensure smooth playback. If you manually download audio files, you can disable this option to avoid duplicates. You can also configure the audio player cache size here.

**Sleep Timer:** Activate a timer to automatically stop playback after a specified period. This feature can be handy when you want to listen to music as you fall asleep. If you need more precise adjustments, activate the precise mode by tapping the configuration icon in the top right corner.

![sleep timer settings screen](21260c_0e84493d6c6f4a0fa7ac62c33e4727db~mv2.png)

**Music Library:** Your music library settings like automatic sync, metadata reading, loading of album artworks, playlists are located here.

![music library settings](21260c_5c078b2ba58447e287b1ef0229046c14~mv2.png)

**Metadata Reading:** when you add tracks to your library, the metadata reader gets to work. This background process reads all metadata from your tracks and organizes them by Artist, Album, Genre, and Composer.

![Metadata Synchronization](21260c_3313ca71b29e4fda9b26d3d5fb820c43~mv2.png)

**Available Modes for Metadata Reader:**

- **Deactivated:** The metadata reader will be deactivated, and file names will be shown instead of data from audio tags.
- **Current Song:** The application will read metadata only for the currently playing song. Use this option if you have a slow network connection to prevent the metadata reader from sending many requests to the cloud server, which may cause playback interruptions.
- **Audio Player Queue:** The app will read metadata for all songs in the audio player queue.
- **Music Library:** The app will read metadata for all songs in the music library.

**Metadata Reading Speed:** You can adjust the speed of metadata reading to load data faster, but be aware that this may use more energy.

**Metadata Reading in the Background:** When background synchronization is enabled, the metadata reader works in the background. However, if the application consumes significant energy during background audio playback, iOS may suspend the app. So, be cautious when enabling the background metadata reader. If you have a large music collection, it’s advisable to use the desktop version of the application for metadata synchronization. You can then use the data backup and restore feature to transfer the synchronized music library from the desktop, which is available in the app settings.

**Normalize Metadata Encoding:** When this option is enabled, the app will automatically normalize metadata encoding for all songs in the music library. This resolves issues where audio tags encoding is broken (e.g., after editing files on a Windows PC) and prevents incorrect information from displaying while a track is playing or added to the library.

**Start Metadata Reading:** Tap this action to start the metadata reader. The operation progress will be displayed below.

**Importantly**, the metadata reader only updates metadata in your music library and does not alter the files stored in your cloud account or local storage. To edit metadata for audio files, use the built-in tags editor, which you can activate from the options menu.

**Reload Metadata:** This action will flag all files in your music library as having missing metadata, prompting the metadata reader to refresh the metadata for every file in your library.

**Online Music Synchronization:** Automatic online music sync allows you to add tracks to your library automatically. To activate this feature, head to music library settings and select synchronized folders.

![Online Music Synchronization](21260c_6f916f43ac184c89b31b008292c9ab4a~mv2.png)

With this option enabled, the application scans all selected folders, identifies supported audio files, and seamlessly integrates them into your library. You can start or stop synchronization by tapping on the corresponding menu action.

![online synchronization time interval](21260c_30f554b0d0a3473ba7628539ce26ace8~mv2.png)

Online music synchronization operates exclusively when the app is in the foreground, which means synchronization may take some time. To speed up the process, leave your app open, connect it to a power source, and enable the 'Screen' -> 'Always active' option in application settings. Alternatively, you can perform online music synchronization on the desktop version of the app and transfer the music library to the iOS version using the data backup restore feature. You can also set how often you want to synchronize your online music library. If you set it to "immediately," online sync will start every time you open the application.

**Offline Music Synchronization:** here you can configure offline music synchronization.

![Offline Music Synchronization](21260c_d799807973194b22bfd4d24478f1da70~mv2.png)

**Synchronized Offline Folders:** When you make an online folder on your cloud server available offline (using the More Actions menu), this folder will appear here. The folder content will be downloaded to the Local Files -> Offline Folders section. When you change the online folder on the cloud server (adding, removing, or updating files), the app will check for changes and update the local copy of this folder on your device.

![Album Covers Settings Screen](21260c_bafa8d6fb0a4465ba696af582c0074aa~mv2.png)

**Time Interval:** You can set the time interval for how often the app should check offline folders for modifications.

**Start Local Folders Scanning:** This option scans all local folders located in the application’s Documents directory to find supported audio files. All these local files are seamlessly added to your music library. Local files located on your device but outside of this application must be added to the music library manually, as the app does not have access to files outside the application Documents directory due to iOS/MacOS security restrictions.

**Important:** It is advisable to periodically initiate offline music synchronization to keep your music library updated with your local files.

**Personalization:** In this section, you can configure the music library screen style to suit your preferences. Three options are available: Plain menu, Grouped menu, Tabbed menu.

![Personalization](21260c_468417e440b846a59af908d5101901b6~mv2.png)

**Album Covers:** Here, you can enable the search for album covers on the internet and within your music folders. You can also choose the quality of album covers stored on your device and manage your cached album covers. By default, the app will check for embedded album covers in your tracks and display them if available. If there are no embedded album artworks and the ‘Search in the folder’ option is enabled, the app will check the enclosing folder for JPEG or PNG images and use them as album artwork for all tracks in that folder. If no artworks are found in the folder and the ‘Search on the Internet’ option is enabled, the app will use the track’s metadata to find album artwork online.

**Playlists:** You can enable the option to add the same song to a playlist twice. By default, this option is disabled.

![Playlists Settings](21260c_8f67546ed47245169983fcea35d5af3f~mv2.png)

**Recents:** you can manage your recently played songs list.

**Favorites:** you can manage the list of your favorite songs.

![favorites list](21260c_64e95955fadf4605930ac98e9bafa0f3~mv2.png)

- **Simultaneous Editing:** Enable this option to add a song to the favorites list in both the music library and the files section simultaneously.
- **Delete List:** You can delete the entire list of favorite songs.
- **Export Songs List:** Similar to the Recents section, you can export the list of your favorite tracks in different formats: M3U, CSV, or TXT.

**Delete music library:** action will erase the music library database, but it will leave your music files untouched.

**Passcode:** Activates the password protection screen if you want to protect your application data.

**Synchronized offline folders:** Manage synchronization of selected offline folders. If you want to synchronize a folder for offline playback, tap the three dots button near the folder name and select ‘Available Offline Mode.’ All new files added to the cloud folder will be downloaded to your device automatically.

**Time interval:** select the time interval for synchronizing offline folders. If you choose "Immediately," offline folders will be synchronized every time you open the application.

**Show full filenames:** Activate this option if you need to view complete filenames, including extensions, in the file manager.

**Online files editing:** You can disable online file editing and switch to a read-only mode for connected cloud services to prevent accidental file deletions. This action removes file editing operations from the user interface.

**Copy files during import:** Specify how the app should handle imported files from other applications.

**Thumbnails for files:** Delete and manage generated file thumbnails to free up storage space.

**Delete temporary files:** Clear the application's cache folder to reclaim storage space.
