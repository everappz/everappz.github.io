Flacbox is a high-resolution music player that lets you create your own cloud music streaming service without limits. Simply upload your Albums, Artists, and Tracks to free cloud storage options like iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, your home computer, or personal NAS storage, and enjoy your music from anywhere with Flacbox.

This app features smart buffering technology for smooth playback. You can download Playlists, Artists, Albums, or individual tracks for offline listening using the advanced download manager. When you’re low on storage, clear your cached tracks and keep streaming from the cloud.

When you import audio tracks, the app scans their metadata and organizes them into a Music Library, grouping songs by Artist, Album, and Genre. Quickly find the songs you want with the built-in Search feature.

If you come across corrupted track metadata, the built-in ID3 Tags Editor can help you fix it.

Transferring music between your Mac or PC and your iPhone or iPad is easy with options like SMB, Wi-Fi Drive, and iTunes file sharing. Additionally, if you have devices like Apple Time Capsule, WD Cloud Mirror, or another personal NAS, you can connect them to Flacbox for access to a vast music library without using extra device space.

Flacbox also has a built-in 10-band equalizer with iPod-style presets, a preamplifier, and a bass booster. If you’re into audiobooks, you’ll find Flacbox handy, as it allows you to create multiple audio bookmarks and adjust playback speed. Moreover, you can stream your music to Apple TV or Google Chromecast devices and even use it in your car with Apple CarPlay.
