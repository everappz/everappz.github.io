## Overview

The Playlists section provides you with the tools to organize your tracks into lists. It includes a content view showcasing all your created playlists, a "..." button in the navigation bar offering various playlist-related actions, and a navigation toolbar with "Search," "Play all," and "Shuffle all" buttons. Furthermore, each individual playlist itself features a "..." button near the playlist title, offering a range of actions specific to that playlist.

## Creating a Playlist

To create a new playlist, either tap the "+" button or the "..." button in the top right corner of the navigation bar, select "New playlist" and assign a name to your playlist. After naming it, tap "Save."

![Creating a Playlist](21260c_7d04499d811f4485a84a94be7a480195~mv2.png)

This prompts the "Add songs" dialog, where you can choose which tracks to add to the new playlist. Tracks are categorized by source type, and you have several options:

### Music library
- Tracks from your music library.

### Local files
- All audio files available for offline playback (you can add local files by downloading them from cloud storage, importing them from WiFi Drive, or using iTunes File Sharing).

### Connections
- All online files located in connected cloud services.

![Add songs dialog](21260c_4773cf56e2574c018a68edac9f18fc0b~mv2.png)

By default, you can add a track to a playlist only once. To allow duplicated songs in a playlist, enable this feature in the app Settings - Music library - Playlists - Duplicates in a playlist - Enable.

## Import Playlist

In Evermusic, we’ve added M3U file import functionality, so you don’t have to create playlists manually.

![Import Playlist](21260c_b8e7f1fbae09458abcd1616faf11d9e9~mv2.png)

First, go to the ‘Playlists’ section. Then, tap the ‘More’ button in the top right corner. From the menu that appears, select the ‘Import Playlist’ option.

On the next screen, choose the file location. Supported options include:

- Connected cloud storage
- Files in the application
- Files on your device

![File location options](21260c_ff428a191ca9480c8997f25cc315c0e1~mv2.png)

Let’s select connected cloud storage and open the folder containing the playlist file. Supported playlist file extensions include M3U, M3U8, and CUE. Select the playlist file and tap ‘Done’ to confirm your selection.

The app will parse the playlist file, create a list of tracks, and locate those files on the storage to compile a final playlist, which will be imported into the music library. It’s crucial that your M3U/CUE file contains the correct paths for media files, and the files should be located at those paths on your storage.

## Playlist Detail Screen

When you open a playlist, the "Playlist detail screen" appears. On this screen, you'll find a "..." button in the top right corner with playlist options and three buttons under the artwork image: "Search," "Continue playback," "Play all," and "Shuffle all." Additionally, there's an "Offline mode" checkbox.

### Search
Perform a search within the current playlist.

### Play all
Add all tracks from the current playlist to the player queue.

### Shuffle All
Similar to "Play all," but shuffles the tracks before adding them to the audio player queue.

### Offline mode
Download all tracks from this playlist to local files. Any new items added to the playlist will be automatically downloaded.

## Accessibility

Our app is fully accessible with VoiceOver technology, ensuring every component has a well-designed label and description. When VoiceOver is active, the app translates the user interface to text mode, displaying only accessible and useful elements to improve navigation speed and convenience. You can also activate text mode in Settings > Accessibility > Text Mode.

For adjusting track position in a playlist with VoiceOver:

1. Open a playlist and tap the "More" button.
2. Select "Change Songs Order." The view will switch to editing mode.
3. Tap the reorder indicator icon near the track title to give it focus.
4. Double-tap the reorder indicator icon quickly. On the second tap, do not release your finger—hold it until you hear a sound indicating the cell is ready to be moved.
5. Now, you can move the cell to a new position.

Other components work as expected, using system-provided VoiceOver patterns.
