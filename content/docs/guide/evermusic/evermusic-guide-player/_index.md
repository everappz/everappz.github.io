## Introduction

The Player is the main application screen where you can control the player queue and playback features such as the equalizer, sleep timer, audio bookmarks, and more. Let’s take a closer look at how to navigate and utilize these functions.

## Accessing the Player

![player screen](21260c_1f52314f2ff24f2789ab08bcd18177a5~mv2.png)

You can access the full-screen player from the mini-player view. On your iPhone, you’ll find the mini player above the tab bar on the main screen. On your iPad or Mac, it’s accessible from the left menu. To tuck away the mini player, tap its icon and swipe downwards. To completely hide the full-screen player, simply tap the close button located at the bottom right corner.

## Supported Audio Formats

The most popular audio formats are supported: mpeg, aifc, 3gp, avi, aif, latm, 3gpp, m4a, loas, cdda, aac, m4p, m4b, ac3, pls, mp4v, m3u, m4r, aiff, xhe, mp1, snd, mp2, wav, qt, wave, m3u8, m4v, mp3, 3g2, caf, mp4, flac, au, w64, ec3, adts, amr, vtt, mpa, aa.

## Playback Controls

At the bottom of the player screen, you'll discover playback controls. These include buttons like "Play," "Pause," "Next Track," and "Previous Track." There are even some hidden by default controls like "Next 30 sec" and "Previous 30 sec," which can be enabled in the app settings. To fast forward or rewind, use a tap-and-hold gesture with the Next/Previous Track buttons. When you want to jump to a specific part of the track, utilize the playback slider.

## Repeat and Shuffle

When you want to change the repeat mode, a simple tap on the repeat button will do the trick. You have several options:

- "Repeat all" – for looping all tracks in your player queue.
- "Repeat one" – for repeating only the current track.
- "Repeat Stop" – to pause playback when the current track ends.
- "Repeat None" – for letting your queue play through without repeating.

If you're in the mood for some randomness, the "Shuffle" option is your go-to. It shuffles the order of your tracks in the queue, giving you a fresh listening experience each time. You can easily switch between "Shuffle off" and "Shuffle on."

## Volume Control

![Volume Control](21260c_2294a6ed19fa40f38c6c0018c319e333~mv2.png)

Find the volume slider on the Audio Settings screen by tapping the sound icon under playback controls. You can change the volume using this slider or standard volume buttons on your device. Additionally, you'll find some handy streaming buttons:

- "Google Cast" lets you connect to Google Chromecast devices.
- "AirPlay" allows you to link up with devices using AirPlay technology.

## Google Cast

For those using Google Cast, you'll spot the Google Cast icon at the bottom of the audio player screen or on the Audio Settings screen. Simply tap it to reveal a list of available devices. Select the one you want to connect to and start streaming your audio content. Just ensure that your Google Cast device and your iPhone/iPad are on the same Wi-Fi network. Keep in mind that not all audio formats available in the app are supported by Google Cast devices, so some tracks may not be streamable.

## AirPlay

![airplay devices screen](21260c_da83814239054956a918e46cd4fcb557~mv2.jpeg)

On the other hand, if you prefer AirPlay, look for the AirPlay button at the bottom of the audio player screen or on the Audio Settings screen, which you can access by tapping the volume button at the bottom of the screen. A quick tap on it allows you to choose the available device to which you'd like to stream your audio content. The application even supports AirPlay2 technology, enabling you to share audio content across multiple AirPlay devices simultaneously.

## Audio Equalizer

![audio equalizer screen](21260c_99d91cee8fc04306b7a45e1bd64ad5ca~mv2.png)

Evermusic comes packed with a 10-band equalizer, complete with iPod-style presets, a preamplifier, and manual equalizer settings. To activate the equalizer, simply tap the "Equalizer" button on the bottom toolbar and toggle the switch control in the top right corner. You can select from a range of predefined equalizer presets like "Acoustic", "Bass Booster", "Classical", and more. If you're a sound enthusiast, you'll appreciate the ability to fine-tune each frequency band using sliders. Feel free to create and save your very own audio equalizer presets. If a track isn't loud enough, you can also adjust the preamplifier gain. We have more detailed instructions about how to use equalizer [here](/docs/howto/how-to-use-the-audio-equalizer-on-your-iphone-ipad-mac-with-evermusic-and-flacbox).

## Player Mode Toolbar

![Player Mode Toolbar](21260c_4d3d3f675b454c3c8429293b7c57e6ba~mv2.png)

For a select few player screen styles you'll find a player mode toolbar at the top of the player screen, right below the navigation bar. This handy toolbar houses three buttons.

- "Search" – Ideal for quickly locating a specific track in your player queue.
- "Playback speed control" – Adjust your playback speed anywhere from 0.02x to 3.00x. Perfect for those who enjoy audiobooks and lectures. To revert to the default speed settings, simply tap "Normal" speed.

## Audio Bookmarks

audio player settings menu

### General

Houses general audio player settings for playback queue, audio output, and state-saving.

**Available options:**

- **Repeat mode**: change repeat mode to specify audio player behaviour when track finished playback. You have several options:  
  - "Repeat all" – for looping all tracks in your player queue.  
  - "Repeat one" – for repeating only the current track.  
  - "Repeat Stop" – to pause playback when the current track ends.

- **Audio processor**: Possible values: AVFoundation and CoreAudio. By default, the AVFoundation audio processor is used. However, due to a known issue with the AVFoundation audio processor in iOS versions 17.0 to 17.6, the crossfade playback feature and the audio equalizer cannot be used simultaneously. To enjoy both crossfade playback and the audio equalizer on iOS 17.0-17.6, switch to the CoreAudio audio processor.

- **Audio output sample rate**: This lets you set the audio output sample rate from 8KHz to 384KHz. This feature is available if the CoreAudio audio processor is selected.

- **Audio output number of channels**: This lets you set the audio output number of channels. Possible values are MONO and STEREO. This feature is available if the CoreAudio audio processor is selected.

- **Audio pitch algorithm**: This lets you set the audio pitch algorithm that will be applied for pitch correction. Available values are ‘Time Domain,’ ‘Spectral,’ and ‘Varispeed.’ Useful if you need to increase playback speed.

- **Spatial audio**: Spatial audio uses psychoacoustic methods to create a more immersive audio experience. Possible values are: Deactivated, Mono and Stereo, Multichannel, Mono Stereo Multichannel.

- **Audio output mode**: (available on iOS only) lets you set audio output mixed mode so audio from this application will blend with other applications. [Instructions available here].

- **Save playback position**: ensures the application saves and restores playback position for songs in your music library.

- **Save audio player state**: saves your audio player state before closing the application.

Once you’ve enabled both of these features, open any folder, album, artist, or genre within Evermusic. You’ll notice a ‘Continue Playback’ button at the top of the screen. Tap to resume.

### Audio Equalizer

Change configuration and presets for audio equalizer. You can read more [here](/docs/howto/how-to-use-the-audio-equalizer-on-your-iphone-ipad-mac-with-evermusic-and-flacbox).

### Playback Speed

This lets you adjust the audio player playback speed. If you need more precise adjustments, activate the precise slider by tapping the configuration icon in the top right corner.

### Crossfade playback

Crossfade allows the songs to flow seamlessly in a continuous mix. The next song begins playing a few seconds before the current one finishes. Please notice that crossfade is not available for AirPlay and Google Chromecast. On this screen, you can select the duration when the current song and next song are playing simultaneously. If you experience issues with crossfade playback and the audio equalizer simultaneously, consider changing the audio processor as described above.

### Gapless playback

 Gapless playback ensures that songs play without any interruptions or silence in between. It’s perfect for genres like classical music, live recordings, and concept albums. If you have issues with gapless playback, consider changing the audio processor as described above.

### Playback Cache

Songs in the audio player queue will be downloaded automatically for smooth playback. If you download audio files manually, you can disable this option to avoid duplicates. You can also configure the audio player cache size here.

### Sleep Timer

Lets you enable a timer to stop playback after a specified timeout. If you need more precise adjustments, activate the precise mode by tapping the configuration icon in the top right corner.

### Accessibility

Our app is fully accessible with VoiceOver technology, ensuring every component has a well-designed label and description. When VoiceOver is active, the app translates the user interface to text mode, displaying only accessible and useful elements to improve navigation speed and convenience. You can also activate text mode in Settings > Accessibility > Text Mode.

For adjusting sliders with VoiceOver:
1. Select the Slider: Swipe left or right until VoiceOver announces the slider.
2. Adjust the Value: Double-tap and hold the slider, then drag up or down to adjust the value more quickly. VoiceOver will announce the new value as you adjust it.

For adjusting track position in a list with VoiceOver
1. Tap the reorder indicator icon near the track title to give it focus.
2. Double-tap the reorder indicator icon quickly. On the second tap, do not release your finger—hold it until you hear a sound indicating the cell is ready to be moved.
3. Now, you can move the cell to a new position.

Other components work as expected, using system-provided VoiceOver patterns.
