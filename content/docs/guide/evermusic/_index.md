Evermusic is a powerful app that turns your device into a full music player, giving you an unlimited way to enjoy your favorite songs like never before.

### Your Music Everywhere

Evermusic lets you build your own cloud music streaming system — just like Spotify, but without any limits. You can move your Albums, Artists, and Songs to cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud Drive, or even your own computer or NAS drive. Once your music is in the cloud, you can play it anywhere, anytime.

### Smooth Playback

Evermusic uses smart loading to make sure songs play smoothly. No more delays or skips. You can also download Albums, Artists, Playlists, or individual songs to listen offline. If your storage is full, you can delete downloaded files and keep streaming from the cloud without any problem.

### Easy Music Sorting

When you add songs to Evermusic, it reads the song info and builds a clean Music Library. It sorts everything by Artist, Album, and Genre. This makes it easy to find what you want. No more messy folders — your music stays neat and easy to use.

### Fix Song Info Easily

If song titles or album info are wrong or missing, don’t worry. Evermusic has a built-in tag editor that lets you fix this quickly. You can update the song’s title, artist name, album cover, and more with just a few taps.

### Simple File Transfers

Sending music from your computer to your iPhone or iPad is easy with Evermusic. It supports many ways to transfer files, like SMB, DLNA, WebDAV, Wi-Fi Drive, and iTunes file sharing. You can also connect Evermusic to Apple Time Capsule, WD My Cloud, or other NAS drives to access a big music library without using up device storage.

### Powerful Sound Controls

Evermusic includes a full 10-band equalizer with ready-to-use presets, a sound booster, and a volume control. You can adjust the sound just the way you like it and enjoy your music in high quality. Every song can sound better with just a few changes.

### Great for Audiobooks

If you listen to audiobooks, Evermusic is perfect. You can add bookmarks, change speed, and save your place so you can pick up right where you left off. It’s great for long stories or learning materials.

### Works Everywhere

You’re not limited to your phone or tablet. Evermusic also works with Apple TV, Google Chromecast, and Apple CarPlay. So whether you’re home, in your car, or traveling, your music is always with you.
