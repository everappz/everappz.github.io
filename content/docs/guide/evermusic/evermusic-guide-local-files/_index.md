## Introduction

The Local Files section serves as a hub for managing files located in the application's "Documents" folder, as well as files added from your device, which are available for offline playback.

You can mark files or folders as favorites and access them in this section. Moreover, you can add a folder located on your device to your favorites.

## Top Toolbar

The top toolbar, located under the navigation bar, offers several actions:

- **Search:** Perform a search within the current folder.
- **Continue Playback:** If enabled in the application settings, this feature restores the audio player queue and the last media position for the current folder, allowing you to resume where you left off you last playback.
- **Play all:** Scan the current folder and its subfolders and add files to the player queue with the current sort order.
- **Shuffle All:** Similar to "Play all," but shuffles files before adding them to the audio player queue.

You can show or hide the top toolbar using a swipe-to-bottom gesture.

## Special Folders

Within the "Local files" screen, you'll encounter several special folders:

### Downloads

All files downloaded from cloud services will appear here by default. You can customize this behavior in the application settings.

### Audio Player

This is the audio player cache folder. By default, the audio player downloads some songs in the audio player queue to apply crossfade and optimize playback. You can disable the audio player cache in app settings or simply remove the folder from "Local files."

### iCloud

Place files in this folder, and they will sync across all your devices connected to the same iCloud account.

### Offline Folders

When you make a playlist, album, artist, or online folder available for offline use, all those files will be downloaded to this folder. If you need to disable offline mode for specific items, you can use the more actions menu or remove the corresponding folder located in "Offline folders."

## Offline Folders

Offline mode is a handy feature that lets you access your favorite music even when you're not connected to the internet. When you enable offline mode for any album, artist, playlist, genre, or remote folder, all the files within that collection will be automatically downloaded to your device for offline playback. You can conveniently access these files in the "Offline Folders" section of the app.

What's even more convenient is that when you add new files to the remote server in the folder you've marked for offline use, these new additions will also be automatically downloaded to your device. It ensures that you have the latest music ready for offline enjoyment.

If you ever need to synchronize an offline folder from your cloud service manually, here's how you can do it: Simply tap the three dots located in the top-right corner of the app, and select the "Synchronize" option. This allows you to update your offline collection with the latest tracks from the cloud service at your convenience.

For those who like to customize their experience further, you can adjust the synchronization timeout settings in the application settings to suit your preferences. This way, you have full control over when and how your offline collection is updated, ensuring you always have your favorite tunes available, even without an internet connection.
