## Introduction

The Local Files section serves as a hub for managing files located in the application's "Documents" folder, as well as files added from your device, which are available for offline playback.

This built-in file manager allows you to edit files and offers various methods to import audio files into the app.

## Offline Folders

![Options menu for offline folder](21260c_66781c00a03b44c2b5a411ab44b803bc~mv2.png)

Offline mode is a handy feature that lets you access your favorite music even when you're not connected to the internet. When you enable offline mode for any album, artist, playlist, genre, or remote folder, all the files within that collection will be automatically downloaded to your device for offline playback. You can conveniently access these files in the "Offline Folders" section of the app.

What's even more convenient is that when you add new files to the remote server in the folder you've marked for offline use, these new additions will also be automatically downloaded to your device. It ensures that you have the latest music ready for offline enjoyment.

If you ever need to synchronize an offline folder from your cloud service manually, here's how you can do it: Simply tap the three dots located in the top-right corner of the app, and select the "Synchronize" option. This allows you to update your offline collection with the latest tracks from the cloud service at your convenience.

For those who like to customize their experience further, you can adjust the synchronization timeout settings in the application settings to suit your preferences. This way, you have full control over when and how your offline collection is updated, ensuring you always have your favorite tunes available, even without an internet connection.
