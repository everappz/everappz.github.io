## This website uses cookies

In compliance with Law 34/2002 of July 11 on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce (LSSICE), we inform you that this website, owned by EVERAPPZ, uses cookies.

The LSSICE applies to any type of file or device downloaded to a user’s terminal with the aim of storing data that can be updated and retrieved by the entity responsible for its installation. A cookie is one such widely used file, which we will refer to generically as cookies.

Cookies are small text files sent to a browser from a web server to record the user’s activity on a website so that this information can be retrieved later while navigating through the different pages connected to the server that installed them.

Cookies typically store technical information, personal preferences, content customization, usage statistics, social media links, access to user accounts, etc.

## Types of cookies

Although **this website** currently uses only **essential cookies**, we provide the following classification of cookie types for transparency and informational purposes.

Below is a classification of cookies based on several categories. However, note that the same cookie may be included in more than one category.

### According to the entity that manages them

- **First-party cookies:** These are sent to the user’s terminal from a device or domain managed by the website’s editor that provides the service requested by the user.

- **Third-party cookies:** These are sent to the user’s terminal from a device or domain not managed by the editor, but by another entity that processes the data obtained through the cookies.

If the cookies are installed from a device or domain managed by the editor but the information collected is managed by a third party, they are not considered first-party cookies.

### According to the time they remain active

- **Session cookies:** These are designed to collect and store data while the user accesses a website. They are typically used to store information relevant only for the service requested by the user for a single session (e.g., a list of purchased products).

- **Persistent cookies:** These store data on the terminal and can be accessed and processed for a period defined by the cookie’s controller, ranging from a few minutes to several years.

### According to their purpose

- **Technical cookies:** These allow the user to navigate a website, platform, or application and use the different options or services available, such as controlling traffic, identifying the session, accessing restricted areas, remembering items in a shopping cart, completing purchase processes, registering for events, using security elements during navigation, storing video or audio content, or sharing content via social networks.

- **Customization cookies:** These allow the user to access the service with certain predefined general characteristics, such as language, browser type, regional settings, etc.

- **Analytics cookies:** These allow the entity responsible to track and analyze the behavior of users on websites to which they are linked. The information collected is used to measure the activity of the websites, applications, or platforms and to create browsing profiles to improve the service based on users’ usage patterns.

- **Advertising cookies:** These manage the most efficient placement of advertising spaces included on a website, application, or platform based on criteria such as edited content or the frequency of ad display.

- **Behavioral advertising cookies:** These manage the most efficient placement of advertising spaces based on user behavior obtained through the continuous observation of their browsing habits, allowing for the development of a specific profile to show ads accordingly.

## Essential Cookies

We use essential cookies solely to ensure the core functionality of the site, such as:

- Verifying server status
- Network error recovery
- Security enforcement
- Performance optimization

These cookies **cannot be disabled** because they are **required for the site** to function properly.
