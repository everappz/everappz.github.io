Hello, and welcome to our Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy helps you to make informed decisions about your relationship with us, so please read it carefully. This Privacy Policy shall apply to the applications published in the Apple App Store by EVERAPPZ SL (“Everappz”) and that are accessible from mobile devices and personal computers (the "App"), and the use of the websites controlled by Everappz in general (the "Website”). App and Website together the "Services".

## Data Controller

## The Information We Collect

When you open our Website, your browser transfers certain data so that it can access the Website: IP address, date and time of the request, browser type, operating system, the language, and version of the browser software.

When you use our Apps, certain data are transmitted by your mobile device: the type of your device (e.g., iPhone, iPad) and its parameters, your IP address, the periods of time in which you use the App, and the events within the application recorded with [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11593727?hl=en) in order to give us the possibility to continuously improve the App. We also collect crash reports using [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics) to find issues in our apps and perform fixes in-app updates. Google Analytics is an analytics software tool that helps us improve our Services by providing statistical patterns of our product use. These tools do not provide us with any additional personal data about you or your behavior online.

## Purpose of Data Processing

We may use the information we collect to:

1. Provide, personalize, and improve your experience with our Apps and Website.
2. Ensure the technical functioning of our Services, develop new Apps and Services, and analyze your use of the Services, including your interaction with Services.
3. Communicate with you for Service-related purposes, including promotional e-mails or messages.
4. Enable and promote the Services, including features and content of the Services, such as sharing, user interactions, notifications and suggestions, and integration with third-party services.
5. Fulfill your requests for Services and improve our Services.

On our website, we process personal data provided by users through the Contact Us form. The purpose of this data is to send you the requested information and address any inquiries, as well as to send you electronic communications about our services, if you have expressly consented to receive them.

The data will be stored as long as its use is foreseen for the purpose for which it was collected.

EVERAPPZ SL is present on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, LinkedIn, Reddit, Vk, and GitHub to inform about its services and any other activities we wish to publicize. However, we will not obtain personal data from users who interact on these social networks unless express authorization is granted.

No automated decision-making is performed with your data.

The website may use cookies; please review our [Cookie Policy](/legal/cookie-policy).

## Legal Basis for Data Processing

The use of your data is carried out with your consent, provided when you fill out the forms for the specific purposes indicated in each. Your data is only necessary for the specific services for which it is requested; without it, those services are not possible.

## Data Transfers and Assignments

We are firmly committed to ensuring that the data you provide to EVERAPPZ SL will not be sold or transferred to third parties without your prior consent under any circumstances, unless there is express consent or a legal obligation.

Our website contains links to third-party websites. EVERAPPZ SL is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of these other sites.

## Rights of Data Subjects

You have the right to access the information stored about you, correct any errors, delete it, restrict its use, object to its processing, and withdraw your consent if you wish. To do so, simply send an email to [admin@everappz.com](mailto:admin@everappz.com), and we will gladly address any questions, comments, or clarifications you may need.

For more information on related matters, the reference site in Spain is the Data Protection Agency, where you have the right to file a complaint.

## Email Collection

We may collect your email address if you choose to subscribe to our newsletter or promotional offers through a form presented in the App or Website. Providing your email is entirely optional. Your email address is used solely to send you marketing materials, news, updates, or special offers related to our App. We do not share your email with third parties for marketing purposes.

You can unsubscribe from our emails at any time by following the unsubscribe link provided in each message or by contacting us directly. We take appropriate security measures to protect your email address and prevent unauthorized access.

## Google User Data

Some of our applications have the ability to connect to your Google Drive account, allowing you to manage files, edit audio tags for media files, and play media content located in your Google Drive account.

Once you connect your Google Drive account to the application, it uses an OAuth access token and the official [Google Drive SDK](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/about-sdk) to handle requests to the Google Drive server. We do not store any of your personal information when you connect your Google Drive account. All your personal information and connection data, including the access token, are securely stored locally on your device in the Keychain, a secure system storage.

You have control over your access. If you ever wish to revoke access to your Google Drive account, you can do so at any time by opening the account settings page in your web browser. Follow the steps outlined here: [How to Disconnect Third-Party App from Your Google Account](https://www.everappz.com/post/how-to-disconnect-third-party-app-from-your-google-account). Additionally, within the application settings, you can disconnect your Google Drive account, and all connection data, including the access token, will be removed from your device.

You can conveniently download your personal files from the connected Google Drive account to your device, and these files will be placed in the App Documents directory. You can remove these files at any time using the built-in file manager in the application. Our applications do not share any information from your Google account.

Our use and handling of data obtained from Google APIs comply with [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.

## Google Mobile Ads

Some of our applications use Google Mobile Ads SDK for monetization. To improve the performance of AdMob, the Google Mobile Ads SDK may collect certain information from apps, including:

- IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device.
- Non-user-related crash logs, which may be used to diagnose problems and improve the SDK.
- Diagnostic information may also be used for advertising and analytics purposes.
- User-associated performance data such as app launch time, hang rate, or energy usage, which may be used to evaluate user behavior, understand the effectiveness of existing product features, and plan new features.
- Performance data may also be used for displaying ads, including sharing with other entities that display ads.
- A Device ID such as the device's advertising identifier or other app-bounded device identifiers, which may be used for the purpose of third-party advertising and analytics.
- Advertising data, such as advertisements the user has seen, may be used to power analytics and advertising features.
- Other user-product interactions like app launch taps, and interaction information, like video views, may be used to improve advertising performance.

## Security and Confidentiality of Your Data

At EVERAPPZ SL, we have adopted all necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the personal data you have provided. These measures are taken to prevent alteration, loss, or unauthorized processing, as required by law, although absolute security does not exist. Similarly, the staff of EVERAPPZ SL is committed to handling your data with the utmost care and confidentiality.

We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on this Website or our Apps.
