## Who We Are

We’re a small, passionate team of two people based in Spain, dedicated to building useful, fast, and user-friendly mobile and desktop applications.

## Our Journey

Our story began in 2006, developing mobile apps for popular Java (J2ME) phones of the time. In 2009, we transitioned to iOS development, working for large companies and gaining valuable experience in professional app engineering.

Eventually, we decided to apply our knowledge and passion to our own projects — removing middle managers, unnecessary meetings, and distractions. This gave us the freedom to focus solely on what matters: making great apps.

## What Drives Us

- **Simplicity and usability.** Our apps are designed so that anyone can enjoy them — no tech skills required.
- **Customer-first mindset.** We read every user review and email, constantly improving our apps based on real feedback.
- **Performance and quality.** We care deeply about speed, stability, and useful features.
- **Purpose-driven features.** We use only time-proven technologies and practices. We avoid trendy or unnecessary features that exist solely for marketing. Instead, we implement only what’s truly useful—based on customer requests and real-world use cases.
- **Accessibility matters.** We invest significant time and effort to make our apps fully accessible, including full support for VoiceOver and screen reader navigation.
- **Privacy first.** We respect your privacy by allowing you to disable all analytics tools from within our apps. We also follow high security standards to ensure sensitive data is stored safely and securely on your device — never on our servers.

## Our Impact

Our iOS and macOS apps have been downloaded over **14 million times**, with thousands of top-rated reviews on the App Store.

We’re here to keep building better software — one thoughtful update at a time.

## Support
