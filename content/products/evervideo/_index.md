{{% details title="What is the difference between Flacbox and Evermusic?" closed="true" %}}
**Flacbox** is built to support all default iOS audio formats along with many additional formats not natively supported on iPhone, such as WMA, OGG, M4A, DSD, and more.<br>
It uses a custom audio engine to handle nearly all formats and offers features like adjustable audio output sample rate and pitch correction.<br><br>

**Evermusic**, on the other hand, supports default audio formats and includes advanced features like crossfade playback, gapless playback, audio equalizer, playback speed control, and more.<br><br>

If you mainly use MP3, ALAC, or FLAC, **Evermusic** may be the better option for its playback features.<br>
If you need broad compatibility with various audio file types, **Flacbox** is the right choice.<br><br>

{{% details title="How do I sync Flacbox?" closed="true" %}}

**Metadata Synchronization**  
When you add tracks to your library, a background metadata reader scans your files and organizes them by Artist, Album, Genre, and Composer.<br>
You can adjust the scan speed for faster loading, though it may increase energy use. You can also disable it entirely to show only file names instead of tags.<br><br>

The metadata reader **does not modify** your original audio files in the cloud or local storage. If you want to edit tags, use the built-in tags editor from the file's options menu.<br><br>

If background sync is enabled, the metadata reader will continue running even when the app is in the background, but keep in mind that iOS may suspend it if it consumes too much energy.<br>
For large libraries, it’s recommended to sync metadata on the desktop version and use the **data backup & restore** feature to transfer it to your mobile device.<br><br>

Use the **'Reload metadata'** action to force a full metadata refresh across your library.<br><br>

**Online Music Synchronization**<br>
Online sync lets you add music from cloud storage to your library automatically.<br>
Go to **Music Library Settings → Sync folders**, select the folders to scan, and the app will find and add supported audio files.<br><br>

Online sync works **only when the app is active**, so it’s best to leave the app open, connected to power, and enable **"Always active screen"** in settings for faster syncing.<br>
You can also do this on desktop and then transfer the library to mobile using backup & restore.<br>
Sync frequency can be configured (e.g. “immediately” starts sync each time the app opens).

**Offline Music Synchronization**<br>  
This scans all folders inside the app’s **Documents** directory and adds supported local files to the music library.<br>
Files outside the app’s sandbox (due to iOS/macOS security) must be added manually.<br>
Run offline sync periodically to keep the library up-to-date with your local files.<br><br>

**Offline Folders**<br>  
Enabling offline mode for any album, artist, genre, playlist, or remote folder downloads all files inside that group for offline access.<br>
They are stored under the **Offline Folders** section.<br><br>

New files added to the same remote folder will be automatically downloaded.<br>
To **manually resync**, tap the three-dot menu and choose **“Synchronize”**.<br><br>

You can also customize **sync timeout intervals** in settings for more control over sync behavior and ensure your offline music stays updated.<br><br>

{{% details title="Is Flacbox Safe?" closed="true" %}}
Flacbox uses only official SDK and secure connections to interact with connected cloud services. Your login and password are not available for the application. All requests from the application to the cloud service are encrypted.<br>
When you enter login and password the application shows you the official authorization page that is provided by the cloud service provider and all authorization process is made outside the application. The cloud service provider sends an auth-token to the application after successful authorization and that token is used to make API calls.<br><br>

Auth-token is a digital key that allows third-party applications to interact with cloud storage. Auth-token is stored on your device in secure system storage called Keychain. You can download your files from the connected cloud service to the device and those files will be placed in the app "Documents" directory. You can remove that files anytime using the built-in file manager.<br>
