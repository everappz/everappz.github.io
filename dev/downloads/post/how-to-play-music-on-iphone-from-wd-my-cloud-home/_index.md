Now, you might be wondering, how can all that music be accessible on your iPhone?

All you need to do now is download the free Evermusic app from the App Store, skip through the introductory pages, and on the last page, select WD My Cloud Home from the list of available cloud services. Then, enter your credentials received during registration.

**How to play music on iPhone from WD MyCloud EX2 Ultra, WD MyCloud Mirror, or any other WD MyCloud Storage**

When you add a connection in the app through Connections > Connect a Cloud Service > My Cloud Home, it's designed to officially support WD MyCloud Home devices.

However, if you’ve been able to connect your WD MyCloud EX2 Ultra, WD MyCloud Mirror, or any other WD MyCloud Storage, here’s a workaround to help you use it.

To make this work, simply create a folder in the app’s file manager after connecting and upload your music files there. It appears WD’s server only allows access to app-created folders in a “sandbox mode” for these devices, so this folder will only be accessible from the Evermusic app.

Please use Evermusic’s file manager to upload your songs to this folder. Once the files are uploaded, you can delete the local copies from your device and listen directly from your NAS.

Here’s how to remotely access your WD MyCloud EX2 Ultra, WD MyCloud Mirror, or any other WD MyCloud Storage music files:

1. Connect to WD MyCloud Storage: go to Connections > Connect a Cloud Service > My Cloud Home.
2. Create a folder on the connected cloud service (visible only in the app).
3. Upload local media files from your device to this folder.
4. Delete the local files from your device once the upload is complete (if you need to free up space).
5. Start streaming by selecting any uploaded media file in the folder created online.

So, if you’ve ever dreamed of having your entire music library, up to 8 TB, right on your iPhone, now you can make it a reality! With WD My Cloud Home and the Evermusic app, you can stream or download your entire collection effortlessly, without the need for subscriptions or monthly fees. Set up is quick, and once connected, you’ll enjoy high-quality playback, full control over your files, and even custom settings like an equalizer.

Thank you for exploring this guide—now, dive into your personal music collection from anywhere, anytime, with Evermusic and WD My Cloud. Enjoy the freedom of your own music library, hassle-free!
