We are thrilled to introduce Evermusic 3.1, the latest update that brings a host of exciting features and improvements to your favorite music companion.

Get ready to elevate your music experience to a whole new level with these fantastic additions:

**1. Crossfade Playback:**  
Experience seamless music transitions with the new crossfade playback feature. With this enhancement, your tracks play continuously without any pauses between the current and next song during switching. This feature is especially useful for classical music enthusiasts, live concert recordings, and concept albums. You have the flexibility to customize the crossfade duration, ranging from 3 to 15 seconds, or turn it off completely in 'Settings' -> 'Audio Player' -> 'Crossfade Playback.'

**2. New Music Library:**  
We've revamped the Music Library section to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. Now, it's easier than ever to find your favorite songs, albums, and artists. Additionally, we've added a 'Synchronization' option to the main screen, allowing you to initiate synchronization effortlessly after uploading new music to your cloud storage. To enhance your organization, we've introduced new sorting options, enabling you to arrange your songs by Name, Size, Song Number, Album, or Artist. Our Metadata reader has been optimized for quicker updates, and you can adjust the metadata loading speed in 'Settings' -> 'Music Library' -> 'Metadata Reading.'

**3. Data Backup:**  
Evermusic now offers Music Library Backup, ensuring the safety of your music collection, playlists, songs, album artworks, and application settings. You can easily back up your data to cloud storage and restore it when needed. Simply navigate to 'Settings' -> 'Backup & Restore,' select the items you want to back up, and tap 'Backup.' Your data will be archived into a single file, and you can choose the destination folder on your cloud storage for safekeeping.

**4. Audio Player Queue:**  
We've enhanced the audio player queue with 'Play Next' and 'Play Later' features, granting you more control over your music queue. You can now rearrange track positions within the queue or remove them as desired.

**5. New iPod Library:**  
Discover your Playlists, Albums, Artists, and Genres from your iPod library directly on the Main screen. Easily add your iPod tracks to the Audio Player queue or save them to 'Files' for convenient access.

**6. Account Editing:**  
Manage your network accounts seamlessly with the new account editing feature. This becomes particularly handy when you need to update login information for your cloud storage accounts within the application.

**7. New Tags Editor:**  
Our Audio tags editor has been revamped for a more predictable 'Identify' action. It now scans your track file name and updates the ID3 tags of your audio file, ensuring your music library is organized and up-to-date.

Upgrade to Evermusic 3.1 today and immerse yourself in a superior music experience. Enjoy the seamless transitions of crossfade playback, explore the improved Music Library, and safeguard your music collection with data backup. These enhancements are designed to make your musical journey even more enjoyable and convenient.

Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to enhancing your music experience further with future updates. Stay tuned for more exciting features and improvements from Evermusic!
