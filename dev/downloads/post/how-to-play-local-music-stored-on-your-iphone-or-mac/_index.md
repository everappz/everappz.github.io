## Step 2: Playing Local Files Located on Your Device

Once you've installed the application, open the "Local Files" screen and scroll down to the "Files on this iPhone" section. From there, choose "Open files..." if you need to select several audio files or "Open folder..." if you want to pick a music folder. The app will scan the folder's content, and all found audio files will be selected.

After tapping "Open," a full-screen audio player will appear, and the files will be added to the player queue. These files will be played directly from the selected location without being copied to the application bundle. If you prefer to copy files to the application every time you open them, navigate to "Settings" - "File manager" - "Copy files during opening" and select "Always copy files during opening."
