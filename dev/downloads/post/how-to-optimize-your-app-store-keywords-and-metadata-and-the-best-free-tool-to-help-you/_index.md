When it comes to App Store Optimization (ASO), **choosing the right keywords** and **perfecting your app metadata** can be the difference between getting discovered ‚Äî or getting buried.

In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through why keyword optimization matters, how to craft better titles, subtitles, and keyword lists, and how to use the **free App Store Keyword Optimization Tool** to make the process faster and easier.

## Why Keyword Optimization is Critical for App Success

Every word you choose in your App Store title, subtitle, and keywords field affects how your app ranks in search results. Good metadata directly improves your app‚Äôs **visibility**, **ranking**, and ultimately, **downloads**.

Optimizing your App Store metadata helps you:
- Reach a wider audience searching for related terms
- Increase organic downloads without spending on ads
- Target niche audiences with specific keywords
- Improve search rankings in multiple countries and languages

But manually managing all this metadata ‚Äî across many languages ‚Äî can quickly become confusing. That‚Äôs where the [Free App Store ASO Keyword Optimization Tool](https://appkeywords.pro/) comes in.

### 1. Fill In Your Title, Subtitle, and Keywords
- For each locale (like **en-US**, **es-ES**, **de-DE**), you‚Äôll see fields for Title, Subtitle, and Keywords.
- The tool shows you **character limits** in real-time (30 for Title/Subtitles, 100 for Keywords).
- Stay within the limits to avoid App Store rejections.

### 2. Press ‚ÄúOptimize‚Äù to Clean Your Keywords
- Hit the **Optimize** button next to the Keywords field.
- The tool automatically:
  - Normalizes commas from different languages (Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, etc.)
  - Replaces spaces with commas
  - Trims extra commas
  - Highlights duplicate or repeated keywords
    - ‚ûî **Blue bubbles** mean good, unique keywords.
    - ‚ûî **Red bubbles** flag keywords repeated in your title, subtitle, or primary locale (en-US).
- Click a bubble to quickly remove a keyword.

### 3. Autosave and Local Storage
- Autosave is enabled by default.
- Your inputs are automatically saved in your browser, even if you close the page.
- Nothing is uploaded or stored externally ‚Äî your data stays 100% private.

### 4. Import or Export Your Metadata (Optional)
- Use **Import from JSON** to load a previously saved metadata set.
- Use **Export to JSON** to download your current metadata as a file you can reuse or archive.
- JSON format is perfect for large apps managing multiple languages.

### 5. Clear All Data (Optional)
- If you want to start fresh, click **Clear All Data**.
- This wipes all fields and resets autosaved values.

### 6. Bonus: Fastlane Metadata Integration Scripts
If you‚Äôre using [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) to manage App Store deployments, we‚Äôve got you covered.

In the `/scripts` folder of the GitHub repo, you‚Äôll find two Bash scripts to help you **import/export JSON metadata** from Fastlane‚Äôs standard folder structure:
- `meta_to_json_dict.sh`: Converts all localizations (`name.txt`, `subtitle.txt`, `keywords.txt`) into a single JSON file
- `json_dict_to_meta.sh`: Reads a JSON file and writes each value back into Fastlane localization files

To use them:
1. Clone the repo
2. Place the scripts in the **same folder as your `fastlane/` directory**
3. Run either script in your terminal

This makes it easier to sync between the tool and your CI/CD workflow.

## Pro Tips for Better ASO
- Focus on **high-intent keywords** ‚Äî words users actually search for.
- Avoid repeating the same keyword in title, subtitle, and keyword field unless absolutely necessary.
- Use all 100 characters in the keywords field ‚Äî every character counts.
- Localize metadata for every major market you target.
- Regularly update your metadata based on seasonal trends or performance changes.

## Conclusion

Optimizing your App Store metadata is no longer optional if you want to grow your app organically. Using a simple, private tool like [appkeywords.pro](http://appkeywords.pro) saves you hours of manual work ‚Äî while ensuring your titles, subtitles, and keywords are clean, powerful, and App Store-ready.
