Downloading songs is one of the ways to listen to music, even with an unreliable internet. Playing music offline is especially helpful when traveling or if your internet connection keeps getting cut off.

Before listening to YouTube songs on your device, you must convert the music file from video to audio format. However, the approach may not be as straightforward as clicking the “download” button because YouTube does not have one. Instead, you may use the services of a YouTube-to-MP3 converter.

First, go to the YouTube video that you want to convert to an audio file. Open YouTube in Safari, find the video and tap and hold the video title to open the context menu. Select the "Copy" action to copy the video URL to the clipboard. You can also click “Share” to copy the video link.

Next, go to a YouTube-to-MP3 converter website and paste the URL link in the text box. Click “Convert” and wait for the operation to complete. The website will then provide you with a link that you click to download the converted audio file.

The file is usually converted to MP3 format, although there are other audio formats available. Once you have downloaded the file, you have the choice to store the file in your iCloud or Local Files.

## Understanding Copyright Issues

There is no issue with converting YouTube videos into audio files. However, a responsible internet user must understand the impact of potential copyright breaches.

Songs and music videos are works of art and are usually protected by international copyright laws.

In other words, all entities involved in the production and distribution of the song, like the singer, producer, and studio, earn something from the sales of that product.

Under copyright law, you cannot copy, reproduce, or re-sell a protected product without permission from those entities. Additionally, downloading a copyrighted product without paying for it is a crime.

Copyrights also protect YouTube songs and videos. Although you may download songs from YouTube, you must also understand the risks and costs.

However, if the copyright provisions allow you to download and use the YouTube video in your preferred manner, feel free to do so.

For example, there is royalty-free music available online that you may download for personal use.

Evermusic allows you to play YouTube songs even when you are offline. This feature allows you to listen to your favorite music even when you are not connected to the internet.

Just follow the steps in this article, from converting the video to an audio file, downloading it, and adding the file to your app.

You should note that there may be copyright risks when downloading YouTube videos unless specific provisions allow you to do so.

If you are uncertain of your options, consider asking for more information from a copyright law expert.
