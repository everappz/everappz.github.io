In today's digital age, we often link our Google accounts to various third-party apps and services for added convenience. While this can make life easier, it's essential to maintain control and security over your Google account. Sometimes, you may want to disconnect a third-party app that you no longer use or trust. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of disconnecting a third-party app from your Google account, helping you ensure your online security.

## Why Disconnect a Third-Party App?

There are several reasons why you might want to disconnect a third-party app from your Google account:

If you suspect that a third-party app might compromise your account's security or access more information than necessary, it's best to sever the connection.

Over time, you may have connected various apps that you no longer use. Disconnecting them reduces clutter and helps you maintain better control over your account.

Disconnecting apps can help protect your privacy by limiting the data shared with these services.
