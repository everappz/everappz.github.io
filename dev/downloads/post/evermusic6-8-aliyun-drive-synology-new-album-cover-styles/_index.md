We’re excited to announce the latest update for the Evermusic app! This release brings new features designed to improve your audio experience and introduces additional cloud storage options. Here's a closer look at what’s new:

### Minimal Audio Player Screen Style

Elevate your listening experience with our new fullscreen album cover display. This minimal style focuses on the album cover, providing only essential controls for a cleaner and more immersive interface. You can activate it under **Settings > Audio Player > Personalization > Audio Player Screen Style**.

### 阿里云盘 (Aliyun Drive) Integration

By popular demand, we’ve added support for **阿里云盘 (Aliyun Drive)**, one of the most widely used cloud services in China. You can now seamlessly access your files stored in Aliyun Drive right from Evermusic.

### Synology Drive Support

Connect to your **Synology NAS server** directly from the Evermusic app for fast and native access to your files. With **QuickConnectID**, accessing your files is even easier, as you can reach them from outside your home network with no need for complex configurations.

### New Album Cover Scrolling Styles

We’ve expanded the personalization options for your album cover scrolling styles. Choose from unique styles such as **MacDoc, Linear, Rotary, Inverted Rotary, Cylinder, CoverFlow**, and more. Find this option in **Settings > Audio Player > Personalization > Album Covers Scrolling Style**.

### Customizable List Cells

For those using smaller screens, you now have the ability to adjust the height of list cells or switch to smaller icons, giving more space for text. Personalize your lists under **Settings > Personalization > List Cells Style**.

### Drag and Drop in File Browser

Managing your files is now easier than ever! We’ve introduced a **drag-and-drop** feature in the file browser, allowing you to move files quickly and effortlessly.

### Improved Album Cover Loading

Album covers for genres, albums, and files stored in the cloud now load faster. Additionally, you can enable **embedded album covers** for cloud-based files via **Settings > Music Library > Album Covers > Load Album Covers for Online Files**.

### iTunes Library Album Covers Fix

We’ve addressed an issue where album covers for tracks in your **iTunes library** were not loading correctly. This fix ensures your iTunes tracks display their covers seamlessly.

This update brings more control, better cloud integration, and a sleeker interface, ensuring Evermusic continues to be your go-to audio player. Don’t forget to share your feedback — your suggestions help shape the future of Evermusic!
