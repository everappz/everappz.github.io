Managing your music files between your computer and iOS devices has never been simpler. We've outlined three easy methods – iTunes File Sharing, WiFi Drive, and SMB protocol – to ensure a smooth music transfer and seamless playback.

## Method 1: iTunes File Sharing

iTunes File Sharing empowers you to effortlessly copy audio files between your computer and your iOS apps on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. This approach is perfect for those who want to enjoy their favorite albums, artists, and tracks from their Mac/PC on their iOS device.

### Before You Begin:

- Alternatively, you can use [WiFi Drive](https://www.everappz.com/post/how-to-transfer-music-from-computer-to-iphone-without-itunes) to wirelessly copy or move audio files between your computer and apps like Evermusic and Flacbox. Simply ensure your computer and iOS device are connected to the same WiFi network, and you can easily transfer files between these apps.
- Another technology to consider is [SMB](https://www.everappz.com/post/stream-your-music-from-mac-or-pc-to-iphone-using-smb), allowing you to directly stream music from your home computer to your iOS device, eliminating the need to copy audio files.

## For macOS Catalina or Later

With macOS Catalina or a newer version, you can use the Finder to share files between your iOS and iPadOS devices and your Mac.

### Requirements:
