Are you an avid SoundCloud user who loves music discovery? SoundCloud is fantastic, but if you're into audiobooks and podcasts, you've probably felt the absence of a key feature in the official iOS client: playback speed control. We hear you! Many SoundCloud users have requested this feature on the SoundCloud Help Community Center, but it hasn't materialized.

Introducing Soundy, your solution to this missing feature. Soundy is the best unofficial SoundCloud player for iOS, and it's absolutely FREE. With a wide range of features like playback speed control, an equalizer, audio bookmarks, and a sleep timer, Soundy takes your SoundCloud experience to the next level.
